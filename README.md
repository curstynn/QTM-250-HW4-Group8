## This demo solution demonstrates how to use the Natural Language API to analyze text documents.
### Text files are processed through the Natural Language API to analyse sentiment, entities, and syntax. The API then outputs the scoring of polarity, magnitude, and the count of text characteristics of the method chosen. The API utilizes machine learning by analyzing thousands of text files to create a baseline for scoring measures, and the API continues learning when other users feed data from their own projects. Users are then also able to construct their own measures for any of the methods. For our project, we utilized the sentiment and syntax methods to develop a measure for the use of slang. We also measured the polarity of sentiment and syntax via the length of comments.

## Step 1: Enable API on CLoud

## Step 2: Import Bodybuilder Comments from Google Cloud (Public Access)

## Step 3: Create a dataframe

## Step 4: Run dataframe through the API

## Step 5: Mount Google Drive
#### You would need to have this folder shortcut in your Google Drive account and that will do the job

## Step 6: Export output to Google Drive Folder to created directory
