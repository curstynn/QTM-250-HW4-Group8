"damn, it's fucked up because I feel like if you were to equalize for height, Terence actually looks better than Chris, but Chris' height really puts in work making him look better."
Wait come back I liked that joke
"Thanks for the appreciation man. Will come back soon for sure, chatting around here always feels good tbh!"
No offence taken! I know I‚Äôm small hence my trying to bulk! What I‚Äôm trying to say is if I‚Äôm trying to bulk should I do a carb on and off phase or is that something else? I‚Äôm very new this this all so ignore my arrogance
Currently running Creeping death 2 and plan on bulk rest of the year as well. At first the constant exercise switching was different for me but after approximately a month into this I can see why it's written as is. Such a mind reliever to just follow a plan and solely focus on putting in the work.
bulking and getting stronger but i‚Äôm getting a big belly.  I drink BCAAs everyday which has creatine HCL and I drink pre or post workout shakes almost everyday.   Is this contributing to the belly?  I feel like I‚Äôm eating sorta clean but am starting to blame the supplements for the bloat
saves a ton of time and I'm pretty sure it saves water (source needed). I can't imagine not peeing in the shower
"I use that feeling as a barometer for mental/emotional  work that I need to engage outside/before the gym. Remember I‚Äôm only speaking for myself here(also a former obese kid/adult) so take this experience as an individual one and apply it however it works for you. But if I‚Äôm feeling defeated or unmotivated inside the gym instead of telling myself the usuals ‚Äústay positive, get motivated, don‚Äôt be a bitch, etc‚Äù or whatever external cue that places judgment or adds further trauma to my experience with my body(remember former obese body that‚Äôs used to internalizing external judgements) I try to give myself a little compassion for having that unmotivated feeling and I‚Äôm practicing acknowledging it rather than pushing that feeling away.

Stepping into the gym for me is about getting closer to a truer more present relationship with my body rather than pushing it again just to feel more trauma and more negative associated discomfort. I don‚Äôt want to have gotten into a strong place in my body only to feel the same negative responses as when I was obese(please note that there are plenty of obese people perfectly in love with their body and their experience so this is not a judgement of that body type).

To make a long and complicated answer even longer, when that feeling comes up acknowledge first and then work past it as much as makes you comfortable THAT DAY. Some days you‚Äôll be motivated to push past 0%, some days you‚Äôll want to give it 110% but the key is to give yourself space and kindness enough for whatever percent you land on that day. Then use it as an indicator of the mental and emotional work to be done outside the gym. To get more in tune to where you‚Äôre actually at mentally and what kind of support and care you need in your day to day. 

Maybe it‚Äôs as simple as ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get enough sleep‚Äù, ‚ÄúI need to fuel myself better before the gym‚Äù, ‚ÄúI need better intra-workout fuel‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just an off day, etc or it‚Äôs as complex as ‚ÄúI really should attend to my anxiety outside the gym‚Äù, ‚ÄúI should resolve that fight I had with my friend‚Äù etc. It will all change day to day, that you can be sure of. Just give yourself time to practice being present with it. It really only takes moments.

Lastly, don‚Äôt forget to acknowledge your wins, your good days. Those can be motivating and can also teach you just how ethereal they are so it‚Äôs ok when you aren‚Äôt having a win day.

Day by day friend. You‚Äôre doing well for where you‚Äôre at now and you should be proud that you‚Äôre taking steps to get healthy and build a healthy relationship with your body and mind. Stay safe and keep being kind to yourself."
Bcuz No reason to be in a deficit everyday to start the prep
Thank you

"Glycogen repletion doesn't matter that much unless you're planning on hitting the muscle again the next day and even then you should be good. It's really only a concern if subsequent performance is critical (i.e. runners, cyclists) and you actually depleted a ton of glycogen. Otherwise you do have the benefits of being in a caloric surplus for muscle building but not necessarily related to glycogen."
yeah this is what i do
Anyone else feel like they have super shallow ab insertions?
True dat!

"Nice. Honestly, I'd start your business program early if you can. I ended up having to stay at school another semester because I couldnt take class B until I took class A, etc. Maybe your first semester start with intro to bus, intro to economics, a&amp;p, and statistics, maybe add in an elective and keep a lot of your ""core classes"" sprinkled throughout. Learn from my shitty advisor, start your pre-req major classes as soon as you can."

"Thanks, man. The tendonitis isn't so bad anymore.  Still can't deadlift very heavy raw or get away with anything but bodyweight chinups, but that's still a huge improvement from last year.

I can do sets of 20 for bodyweight dips when I couldn't even do one last year. 

I haven't blasted since Spring of this year. Probably gonna bulk again in September."
"Sounds like those calories are working for you so far. Something to keep in mind, your weight loss will plateau/stop. Don't get upset, just means you have to increase the deficit (lowering calories and/or increasing cardio). 

&gt;If those things do happen during a long cut, how would I counteract that? By eating my maintenance calorie amount for awhile?

They are not guaranteed - just possible. Especially if you go into lengthy cuts.

Diet breaks - going back to maintenance is a good tactic. Especially when you don't have a specific end date necessary for the cut."

"Thanks mate, yeah finally doing a proper off-season, not just winging it haha. Ahh cheers mate"
Those jekyll and Hyde ones are ridiculous. I always got a crazy workout with them. Ended up feeling like I was doing more harm than good though because I was consuming like 400mg of caffeine or something stupid like that

Thanks again. Ever since I had a separate arm day (in GB) I‚Äôm considering keeping it hence why High Evolutionary/GM. Gonna watch some reviews and then maybe run HE or Collossus as GM sounds like the most intensity and am on a deficit

"I started off at ~230 in terrible shape. I spent several months just weight training, being more active, and cutting sugar. I dropped down to 170 and felt way better. 

Just pick one thing a week, and do it. It sucks at first, but you feel so much better in just 8 weeks. 

For reference, I‚Äôm almost 230 again, but now I have shoulder veins and chest striations. It fucking rocks."

I have Vascular arms , abs and my chest  also starting on my legs . Does this mean my bf is to low ? And I‚Äôm not consuming enough calories . I don‚Äôt want to be to vascular as I‚Äôm a woman and don‚Äôt think the chest is all that attractive nor legs , however I‚Äôd like to know what percentage I‚Äôm at . Does this make sense ? Any thoughts and advice good people all welcomed to help me on my way I have a long way to go ;))"

"Yeah then to be honest you should be doing like maybe a burger and fries every couple weeks for the mental aspect of it. Refeeds and big cheat meals aren't on your radar yet.

It‚Äôs likely the loss of water and glycogen which is the combination of carbs and water in between your muscles and stuff that is used for energy. Generally when people consume very little food for even only 12-15 hours their glycogen levels are to be depleted becauee that‚Äôs the first to go over fat or muscle or anything so those are likely just low. In a day or two of normal eating and lifting you‚Äôll be totally fine üôèüèª

If I wanted a luxury car, I'd get a luxury SUV.  If I wanted all of the above, I wouldn't settle for a ""jack of all trades master of none"" like the Tesla.  I'd just get multiple cars... which I did."

So what? Still impressive
"thought I fucked myself out of the $1400 stimulus. I surprisingly received it in the mail in a check, but I had no idea what it was when I grabbed the envelope from my box.

"I had a rotator cuff injury due to a sports accident roughly 5 years ago. I have went to countless physiotherapists, rhematologists, doctors, and chiropractors. Nothing has helped and I think because of the years of my left shoulder injury, my right had to compensate and now I am starting to get the same symptoms in the right as well.
  

  
I have done hours of research and I have not been able to find a definite cause, but I believe that my infraspinatus is weak providing no support for my shoulder. All the PT exercises have either led to more pain and end up targeting my upper traps. I have seen somewhere that if your infraspinatus is weak then your upper traps will start to compensate for the shoulder, and because of this, I am starting to feel the pain shoot up to my neck and mid-back as well.
  

  
This is kind of a last resort post, where I really dont know what else to do.
  

  
If you guys have any insight please let me know. THANKS IN ADVANCE"
Yeah that‚Äôs what I meant sorry if it wasn‚Äôt clear
"So glad my friend was with me today when looking at an investment property...in the elevator with the sellers agent and a male resident.

I've told my friend before it's something everyday gd day ...not that he doesn't believe me, but just was so blatant, and glad he witnessed that. Got me thinking the only place that doesn't really happen is at my gym (to me at least). So thankful for that. /endrant"

It‚Äôs hard to imagine as a good coach for athletes either honestly
Wow
you are very fat. cut dude. you aren‚Äôt gonna grow when you‚Äôre fat as shit anyway.
Yeah even competitors cycle. I think it's relatively fine if you cycle. I heard to be careful too cause you'll feel recovered fast but you're actually not and you can hurt yourself. I had a buddy to tren or dball for football. He got super bloated cause he didn't cycle. He was huge though. Make sure you eat a lot!
"I'm currently on the GZCLP program. I want to incorporate some more bodybuilding exercises into it. If I wanted to grow my biceps, chest, and lats, how would I go about this? How many exercises for each group, how many sets x reps, how many days a week, etc should I be adding?"
"One time there was a guy at my gym straight up yelling at himself like ""FUCK! SHIT! WORTHLESS!"" like fuck dude calm down. Tiny fella too and pretty sure he was still in high school. I've seen him lots of times being somewhat noisy but that one time it was just ridiculous. Cringy as hell"
Bad dad joke ik
"Sometimes when I'm super wiped out or just not in the right mood to push myself, I'll be toying with the idea of skipping my last set or even a full exercise. And then a total cutie will come along and start doing something nearby and it gives me the motivation to carry on because I allow myself to live in the fantasy that maaaaaaaybe she's checking me out so I'd better give my all.

The delusion can exist only so long as I never speak to the cutie, because if I don't ask then the reality is that she's simultaneously mirin and not mirin. I appreciate you, Schrodinger's cutie."

Ah dude I appreciate that! Hopefully I bring some redemption in two weeks with a better placing. Going to do another show with my posing fixed and come in a little harder/leaner hopefully
Fantastic shape for your age. You have blessed back insertions. Keep it up and by 19 I can see you competing.
Shoot juice plus 2 years training and that can be you.  Dial in diet and you can be even better

"I get forearm splints doing straight bar curls every time, and then it hurts like hell when I do other curls. I can't say if this will work for you, but I just did single arm concentration curls with a cable stack until it healed up, and now I stick to dumbbells. Ymmv."
would you suggest adding straight arm pulldowns to the beginning or end of my workout?

Funny how they have so many categories and almost all of them only have two poses to judge off of. And one of them is just bending over and showing your ass. Women's bodybuilding needs a change.

It‚Äôs definitely uncomfortable but feels like a good type of pain. But for me in my head leg and chest soreness feels a bit different. I forgot to add I did swim too after my leg workout after not swimming for over a year or so

Fuck. These last few days of 28 Days Later (which has become 30 Days Later since I was traveling a couple of days this month so I just did shoulders/arms in a hotel gym instead of the prescribed leg/back days) are making me question life. I hurt everywhere. I get to the gym and feel full of dread. I get home from my workout and become totally useless. And I fucking love all of it. BB is such a good way to stare into some darkness and come out smiling on the other side.
"I've got no idea, that's ultimately up to the judges.

"No problem! That's pretty good, although lateral raises are definitely better suited to the 15-25 rep range, which prevents excessive swinging.

Also, come to think of it, you probably don't need both bench press and dips, they have a very similar movement pattern.  If I were you I'd keep which one I prefer and swap out the other for some variation of chest flyes."
Damn that was dope

Bro I'm just giving you some advice about powerful amphetamines that I've been taking for practically my entire life. You don't have to listen. Talk to your doctor and try them to see if they're worth it to you but start at a low dose
"Definitely flatter, but the lighting is horrendous so to understand anything was very difficult."
Is that your normal drop. I'm 200 now and looking to bulk to 230 but may shoot for 250.

"Brothers what are good iPhone recommendations if I just want dope pics, good battery and clear quality for youtube/audio/insta? I have iPhone4 forever now and can afford a new one but don't want to spend like 1000+. Any recommendations?"
"Good shampoo and conditioner can only be bought at a salon or barber and I'm not joking. $350 is way too much though.

Get some tea tree stuff then use it sparingly. The best thing you can do to your hair is not overwash it."
"No worries, I appreciate you taking the time to explain in further detail to help me understand. Truthfully I prefer classic physique as something I'm shooting for. I don't have any desire to be open bodybuilding size, nor do I think my frame can handle it. I still have a lot of room before I would hit my weight cap. I'll try my best to create the illusion, and build my shoulders and lats up.

 I feel like I have above average insertions/genetics, so I don't think it will prevent me from getting a pro card in the future in one of the divisions. Perhaps beyond that it could hurt me, but just shooting for enough size to have a shot at getting a card."
Lmao na homie negligible
"Nice base, no weak or strong points so.. just need to keep growing.."
"Yeah, when you do take a deload or maintenance week you‚Äôll probably see a lot of growth. I think giving up the fear of over training and just embracing feeling like hell a lot is responsible for a large portion of my growth in the last year.prolonged stress is like pulling back the slingshot on hypertrophy."
"This dude crazy, if he had just a little bit more size on the chest, he‚Äôd be literally a Olympian contender."

You wonder why your dad abandoned you
"you really think so? i feel like coleman's back was way freakier. it was both wider, and it looked like huge benign tumors were just hanging out on his upper back"
Pretty necessary. Rows and deadlifts are completely different things. Not doing horizontal pulling is like not doing horizontal pressing or not doing hip hinging. Also no reason you can‚Äôt do rows and deadlifts on the same day. Just do chest-supported rows instead of free weight rows if that‚Äôs too taxing on your lower back.
"Bro just prick your finger, if the blood is red then you're probably fineee."
"To show off the diaphragm. The stronger it is, the biggest the vacuum. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong."
"Idk my exact cals yet, it might be maintenance for me. I am a bit over 6'1"", 232lbs, and have a fair amount of muscle."
Holy shit dude! You're gonna crush it!! Fuckin right!!
Very true
Ok that one I can understand from a health perspective. But eating 300 cals in a surplus coming from fats or carbs will result in the same weight gain.
It‚Äôs normal to be crazy exhausted after doing legs when you‚Äôre not used to legs. Your body will acclimate. Just don‚Äôt be stupid in the gym and you‚Äôll not get injured.
Well I guess this is your retarded way of admitting you lost the argument

"Great thanks I'll look it up, definitely see a physio when I can as well. Cheers"
I agree - I wonder if it's leg length or height or something with Lauralie. Her physique is out of this world but there's something 5% off in the comparison shots.
" I point man, you‚Äôre bulking it‚Äôll have like a 0.2% aesthetic benefit unless you‚Äôre eating a fuckton more than you need.
Just eat clean, well digesting foods, stay away from junk and too much fats and sugar and you should be ok"
"Canada here,

It just feels so good to be back in the gym after ease of lockdown restrictions, so I haven't been in the gym for 6 months. Calisthenics at home just didn't give me the same pump. But holy shit, the DOMS are stupid. I could not fully extend my arms for 4 full days.

Ugh, it's an uphill battle for the next week or two."
That actually sounds like a fucking party man lol
"I don't know man. I can totally admit that you could be right. Life's been really hard, doing this. 

But I've never had feelings like this for anyone before, and I know he hasn't either, and that just makes me think it's okay to work at it for a little while longer. The pros of a potential lifelong big gay love fest outweigh the current difficulty. That feeling won't last forever, but I want to at least make an attempt while it does.

I guess it just feels like real love and I'm not quite ready to give it up. I get what you're saying though, really. I'm in therapy and have a decent support network so hopefully I'll know when to quit."

"Itll start a civil war. Lets do it.

"Thank you, happy new year to you too. 

Most likely the protein breakdown is happening on a very localised level. Even eating plenty, your muscles may still breakdown fat or protein for energy, due to hypoxic conditions and lactic acid buildup. 

Or perhaps, like me, you just smell bad when sweating lots. Happens to the best of us, as we also excrete nitrogen in significant amounts through urea in sweat, this is simply upregulated during intense exercise. 

In both situations, its perfectly normal and happens to everyone."
"Are there any long-term negative effects from using gloves while lifting? I have a skin condition that makes getting calluses incredibly painful, and was just wondering if there's anything I need to look out for moving forward."

Awesome! Good to know
Make sure not to put grow lights over carpet! It can light it on fire.
"Quote directly from CD2:

I want one more week of really pushing hard here. Do sets of 8 until you can barely get 8. Now here is how you do your last set. I am sore from this right now! Go up a little more, not much but only do 3 reps. Do all 3 slow. Drop one plate off of one side NOT both sides, and do 3 more slow reps. Then drop another plate off and do 3more slow reps. What you do
is sets of 3 reps, slowly, until you hit 30 reps total for the set. All reps need to be slow, and again, only one plate at a time off of one side. We‚Äôll call this 4 work sets. 4 total work sets

Eh.... they were different times to be honest.

He was popular at a time where social media/message boards/online fitness weren't so prevalent and widespread, and were more of a nerd/introvert type thing, which is why the ""wowww aesthetics and having sex I will lose my virginity, alpha!!!"" thing pulled off so well.

Sure, they're not spending time coming back and forth to your table, it's just a one-time deal, so you don't necessarily need to tip them 25-30% like for a normal sit-down meal. Depending on the restaurant, I usually tip maybe $4-$5 per entree ordered, but even $2-$3 on an entire ticket will add up for them."

"I know most people do better with anywhere between 8 to 20 working sets for arms but I was blessed with piss poor recovery. 4 Working sets a week is around my minimum effective volume. From there I add a set each week or so and build up to 8 which is getting close toy maximum adaptive volume. This is my program as it looks at the start of the month. Didn't think it was necessary to state I increase volume over the meso since I thought that was a given.  As for my training I've been training fairly consistently for a year or so, gone from 75kgs to around 86kgs, not particularly lean but haven't added any chub so it's all muscle more or less.

Each Time I try to approach high volume I burn out, regardless if I'm smart about reps in reserve or deloads etc. I'm just not built for it unfortunately."

"Absolute safest? TRT. You can have normal/slightly elevated physiological levels of test without the normal fluctuations so now you‚Äôre at an advantage over naturals.

After that hgh in moderate doses (&lt;5iu for men and ~2iu for women). You get some better sleep and recovery and maybe a tiny bit of growth but it‚Äôs not really enough to cause the carpal tunnel and insulin sensitivity issues that high hgh does.

Beyond that it‚Äôs about monitoring your health and reactions. Not just labs but blood pressure, heart rate, HRV, cholesterol levels, get an ekg, do your cardio, etc. Running the shortest effective cycles on the lowest effective doses and maximizing every other facet of training, nutrition, and recovery will give the biggest bang with the lowest risks, especially when paired with adequate time off/cruising. 

I see the arguments here already about underground gear and fakes but that‚Äôs old news. Any reputable source is getting their raws from the same few suppliers. Those suppliers will provide testing reports on every batch. As long as the source is sanitizing vials and filtering the oils you don‚Äôt have much to worry about anymore. When they run out of something they mark it out of stock and that‚Äôs that. It‚Äôs too easy to send a sample out for testing now and enough people get blood work that they‚Äôd figure out any fakes and that source would be ruined with a few forum posts and word of mouth."

That sucks man. It was infuriating having gyms shuttered while Walmart and Home Depot were packed. Gyms are so important for the mental and physical health of many yet the TPTB don't give a flip. Murphy will shut things down again if he isn't stopped. I live in PA now but when I visit my hometown in North Jersey its bizarre seeing everyone in masks and acting all paranoid. It's a relief I don't have to wear a mask at my gym. When I Covid I just stayed out of the gym for bit until I felt better - just like what normal people do. But sucks man.

So any recommendations for any FREE online apps to help with creating workouts? Just recently joined the local YMCA and want to start working out to hopefully lose some pandemic pounds

"I agree, but I‚Äôm not a mod"
Thank you!
He is basically 300lb on stage lol no way will he be able to compete in classic
Everyone had to wear the stupid wristband lol. I‚Äôm waiting for judge feedback rn. I feel placing was pretty fair tho
This is definitely an unpopular opinion. But I think Nick Walker is starting to lose control of his midsection. At the Arnold you could see a bit of a split in his abs and some distension. His conditioning was still the best so he deserved the win. But I‚Äôd hate to see him go down the path of Phil Heath with his gut
Definitely. Great to hear that someone who used to be overweight has found a way to stay consistent and disciplined with his diet. 12 percent in no time
Sick shit dude keep it up
"don't mind him, his brain stopped after reading ""dick sizes"""
Are weighted planks safe for your spine? (Like putting a 45 lb plate on your lower back while planking)
"Bro I could cry for you. I can't imagine how pissed off you must be about that. Trying to push yourself so much for those gains to only get thrown back a mile. Don't do what everyone else seems to and give up for the next six month and loose two yrs of gains. Keep wtf you have on your body right now. Fuck it to and bulk and hit legs, abs, hard lol"
"Looking like a beast, best of luck."
"1. Scary, scary dosages
2. Genetics, his sister is also a professional athlete"
Wtf kind of question is this?
"I looked like this at 12 weeks out from my first show and still could‚Äôve been leaner, no way he‚Äôs going to be able to push hard enough to look as lean as he should in 6 weeks"
No. I can answer for him.
What‚Äôs your cycle looking like
Wow. I can see why he got that nickname
Holy fuck. John Meadows leg day with like 3 drop sets = pain. I stood up from the leg extension machine and I literally had to squat down cause my quads refused to listen for like a minute
"You are looking fantastic. Better than most already look.

I‚Äôd suggest doing something I learned from Ryan humiston. He‚Äôd make mention before he‚Äôd compete he would for a either a week or two straight, I forgot how long, before competition he would do 180 walking lunges. Every. Single. Day.

He would torture himself but his legs would pop. I can‚Äôt recommend much other than think about leg gains and how to manifest them. Otherwise you look great thumps up!"
"Cool, I‚Äôm not sure what your asking here with the ‚Äúwhat do you think‚Äù you look like shit on the left but if your power lifting you prolly don‚Äôt care. The right you look like a newbie bodybuilder."
"Probably, but Hadi is still like 5‚Äô tops. That‚Äôs always going to hinder him."
And you're torturing yourself because??
Are you gonna make a thread like iskeezy did? Was an interesting read.
thats a very strange and dark sub
Wow ok thanks for all the suggestions!
Nobody cares m8
You too?! Thought it was only me haha
"Yes. My lover had this weekend off and no schoolwork to grade so we binged watched movies and ate like complete shit the whole weekend. 

Well I got almost no sleep and had shitty food and I feel like shit at work rn but it was one of the most fun weekends I‚Äôve had in a long time."
I‚Äôm just waiting for someone to take a chance on me and give me a job so I can gain experience. What can I do to make myself more appealing to employers while I‚Äôm unemployed. Politics/nonprofits field if anyone has experience there
Yeah I‚Äôm probably over thinking it lol but better safe than sorry. My cycle usually never go over 1g total of gear per week but I still think it‚Äôs a good idea to get checked out.
Nah idiot the guy above me said he looks mid 30s. Stop riding his cock u small faggot
"I mean, kind of. It's hard to say without seeing this Phil vs let's say his 2013 Olympia size. I don't think Phil would've won even with the midsection but to each their own my friend."
A positive of going to an Anytime Fitness is that there are no serious lifters who go heavy on anything other than bench so I am in the top 1% of lifters at my gym. But the negative side of that is that I don't have a gym nemesis to try to lift more than. So badly do I want to be in a rack next to someone and out squat them in a competition that they don't know we are having
"Pretty much. Education is key. It's just a shame anti-intellectualism seems to be so rampant.

Just banning SARMs alone will just lead to something else being released that may be horrifically dangerous long term but no one will know about it (kinda like SARMs already, but potentially much more so) and we'll just continue on like that."
IIFYM. Unless your are getting comp ready I would stress too much.

I definitely disagree with any kind of implant in the pro bodybuilding world but I don't have a problem with lipo and it could probably be very beneficial for those with unfortunate fat distribution.
Solid af bro
"Look for Prime handles, they‚Äôre superior IMO."
"Good advice. I'll look into leg presses. 

oh yea the clicking is normal. I have an AC joint tear in my shoulder and it kinda migrates around. The back clicking kinda moves my whole body. I can ""hear"" it echo through my body."
"Hell yeah, when you completely understand how to solve it you just go with the flow and it really is fun, the problem is getting to the part where you completely understand it haha"
Lol. On the joints mostly. And it's not linear. Lifting wrong at 80 lbs is gonna injure a weak person much rarer than 315 on a strong person lifting wrong

Sleep meds shouldn't be described to easily. There are so many things to consider before taking them. Go to the root of the problem and try to fix that instead of taking meds that are so easily abused.

Not saying OP isn‚Äôt legit, but I believe 3 days is like the minimum waiting time before you can start posting on some subreddits. Not sure what it is on this sub though. Just seems a bit sketchy at the current moment, maybe OP‚Äôs asleep or something right now. If OP doesn‚Äôt respond tomorrow though, keep an eye on the account and if it starts spamming this post everywhere with the same title it‚Äôs probably a bot account."

"Yep! The show I‚Äôm entering is an NPC drug tested show. I have absolutely nothing against geared athletes, but competing at a drug tested show if you‚Äôre on seems pretty lame to me. At 24, I feel like I have some growing to do before I make that decision."

Edit: given your post history I think you need to get on the straight and narrow before doing something so drastic to your body. This is an incredibly self-destructive path and I really hope you can be in a healthy place and participate in this sport."

Logan‚Äôs routine was very cool but this was epic.
You said alright let‚Äôs calm down to someone replying explaining something to you? Seems like she was just explaining something to you.
i agree with other guy that 20lbs in 4 months is too fast. How did your lifts progress? You were pretty lean at 153.
Did you drop 10lbs the first week? I absolutely do not believe you had 10lbs of excess water weight. You‚Äôd have serious edema.

Agreed. Spend our tax dollars on some shit that actually matters.
Front delts? It might just be your lagging body part as that muscle gets overtrained enough already from doing pressing movements. It seems that your bicep has grown bigger than your front delts in this pic.

"Your hamstring drop is really sick in the side chest. Overall, I love your shape man For your off-season I would work on building lats, you're a little narrow up top from the rear. 

The one glaring thing is going to be conditioning. You look like you're around 10 wks out, give or take a couple weeks. I would strongly recommend picking a show that's at least six weeks later than the one you have scheduled if you don't have emotional attachment to that show. If you have to do this show in four weeks, I don't really know if it's possible to get in shape without losing too much of the size you've put on. 

I wish you the best man! By no means am I dogging on you. My second competition season I tried to force a show too early, and placed really badly. I competed a year and a half later with much better results because I started my prep much earlier.

Edit- ""dogging."" I noticed autocorrect changed it to digging."
lmao. but same

Its so annoying because as people i actually kinda like some of them. Yes maybe they‚Äôre setting a bad example for teens like me but they definitely do inspire my generation to train
"Yeah like what? No guarantee he places that well at 212 and it‚Äôs not like he is some young guy either. Plus when you factor in that how well you do at the olympia affects the money you earn from sponsors etc, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me to switch."
Just cause you‚Äôre being ironic doesn‚Äôt make it funny :)
Noooooooooo no sad!!
Right? what a completely normal thing to say lol
I work 40 to support the family and another 40 on starting my new career as a real estate broker
That's also a good way to burn out. I found building positive habits to be the most efficient and long term way to achieve things because I can do things that are beneficial to me/my life without the mental effort of being motivated every day.
GD. I‚Äôm so pissed right now. If I can‚Äôt lift I can‚Äôt function.
"Hoping he can! Would be a sight to behold. Can you imagine the story and the hyp there would be? Dude comes in off every show leading up to the O placing 3rd or lower, and then shows up to the O peeled to the socks out of his mind and wins (or atleast places way higher than expected like top 10)."

Agreed and it didn‚Äôt really work out for the people I know (unsurprisingly lol). I know lots of guys and gals on gear and they look amazing but they either compete or have been training for a long time.

Thank you!  I started consistently lifting weights about 8 years ago; this will be my first time competing
"It's probably a mobility or strength deficit in either a retractor or a protractor muscle. Train your serratus, train your rhomboids, train your traps. Do a lot of slow push ups. Become intimitately familiar with them if you want to be good at them. And don't be afraid to let your scapulae move in a movement, protraction and retraction are natural movements of the scapulae that you shouldn't fight (the opposition to this is powerlifting form in which not protracting may reduce range of motion. With push ups, this isn't the goal at all until you're close to max testing them)."

"Rant incoming

I'm thoroughly disappointed at my gym and am about to channel the inner Karen I never knew I had.

They closed for a week to renovate, and told us to use other locations in the meantime. When they reopened yesterday, I was impressed at the new paint job and upgraded flooring. However, the excitement stops there. There are tidbits that I can adjust to without trouble but there are some issues


They threw out some strength machines to make way for more treadmills and bikes. Instead of having 2 proper barbells as previous, there is now one regular barbell and one trap bar, the trap bar one looks pretty cool but we really needed more regular barbells, not less. They also got rid of the pussy pad which is an issue if you want to do barbell hip thrusts and might want to fertilise eggs one day (also lot of older guys who come in few times a week do squats with the pussy pad understandably). And for some dumb ass reason, 4kg dumbbells are missing (so they went 1, 2, 3, 5 up etc).

The most annoying part was the fact that they said this was done based on ""community feedback"" but I reckon the decisions were done by corporate wankers who know nothing about the community of regulars and just wanted to flex on outsiders, because all we long time regulars wanted was a fucking 2nd power rack so all the benchers and squatters don't have to line up behind mr bicep curl in the rack, and instead they took away the 2nd regular barbell which means you can no longer take it out to deadlifts, barbell rows or hip thrusts if someone is in the power rack (well you can use the trap bar deadlift but most people here prefer the standard bar, and there should be options for everyone not limitations). They also turned the power rack into a safety hazard- they positioned it too close to some of the EZ bars, too close to the wall behind so there is zero space for spotters, managed to throw out the clip/clamps to keep the plates on the bar and have not bolted the power rack to the ground (it was bolted before this renovation).

I like this local gym live-in because it's a short walk from home but if they don't at least reinstate some of the shit they threw out that people actually need (me included of course), I'm tempted to just take the drive to another location."
"Nah, carbs are still at 150-190 until 3 weeks out, then I‚Äôll drop them to 50-100 until it‚Äôs time to carb up"

Pretty damn smart idea tbh
"So I played competitive golf from about the age of 11 up through college and a few years after. My last year of high school I got very interested in lifting weights and got pretty serious and continued lifting in college and after. Because golf is an extremely one sided sport my right side has become much stronger and bigger than my left. Basically the back side of my body has become extremely strong on my eighth side, and the front of my body has become extremely strong on my left side. I‚Äôm hoping somebody can help me fix this."
"I feel like there's a slew of protein questions in today's thread. But I realized I have an opened container of Cellucor that expired in summer of 2018. It smells just fine, looks fine, tastes fine. It's two flavors in one tub because I wanted to get rid of a tub that had maybe 2 lb left and poured it into another. 

This stuff should still be fine to consume, right? I know 12-19 months is the norm when it comes to past date whey but... help me out here?"
We also have someone like this in our subreddit.
Agreed. I said in another comment that there are people who allegedly have (I.e Quinton Eriya). But I have never heard of a natty winning/ top placing a pro show. You‚Äôd have to think a guy with peak Phil Heath level genetics could possibly win a pro show natty. But then why would you not gear up and be the next Phil?
Definitely depends on what you want out of the vacation

That caption is definitely not true. Those are some ridiculously awful peaks lol
Absolutely there is a LOT of shit on rest days . But its not like the day it self is somehow magically affective . Its just a time period where you allow your body to grow . Which also happens from workout to workout. But a rest day is one of the ways to manage weekly volume .
You can get plenty of gains while literally never going to failure.

Disagree. Why spend 2 hours a day in the gym when you can get more out out 1? Why waste energy and recovery time doing 10 more sets when you only need 5? Progressive overload is king but failure training isn't the devil.

A little bit of discomfort when unracking the bar, but a hell of a lot better than it felt 2 weeks ago.  Gonna go back to full-power for my upper body routines and hopefully be back to normal with lower body exercises by December.

Busch's social anxiety update: Went to a barcade with my bro on Friday.  Got drunk and played hella games.  By about 1am me and my bro realized we were on a bro-date and needed to talk to some women.  I offered to play Dig Dug with an amazon qt and got her Snapchat.  I got a healthy mentality shift because while I'm almost definitely gonna get ghosted by her, I don't really care üôÇ I was making all my stupid excuses to not talk to a girl, then I did it anyway and it went well.  I'm getting over my fear of rejection, and I'm really proud of that.  I used to only be able to do that while blackout drunk, and I'm slowly getting to the point where I can be outgoing and functional at the same time.  As long as I don't get caught up in the trap of going to places that have no women at them every weekend, I think things are looking up and ol' Busch just might obtain felatio one of these days."

"I'm partial to Orijen. It's literally better sourced protein than I eat with a wide variety of source types (free range chicken/ducks, eggs, bison, heritage pork, fresh or saltwater fish etc) to choose from. I also like that they are ""whole prey"" so lots of bone/marrow and organs. Those are my favorite bits so I figure my dog should get them, as well.

The same company makes another brand in the USA (they're Canadian) with US sourcing so it's a good bit less expensive but the animal content is a little lower with lentils and some root veg rounding out the calories."
Oh hi lol
"So I could use some advice. Nothing serious, just about the intricacies of counting macros. My mom is asking my advice in doing so. She is worried she isn't getting enough calories, or getting the ""correct"" amount of carbs, protein, and fat each day. 

However, I honestly don't know how to answer that haha. I've been counting macros for about 6-8 months, but I just do it more as a way to make sure I'm not eating a shit ton of calories, and making sure Im getting enough protein. I only focus on carbs if my weight loss seems to stall, then I try to lower those. Fat, I have no clue.

I also work a physical job and go to the gym every day to lift, and do half n hour of cardio. She does some small lifting at home with light dumbells, and uses a treadmill. But I don't really know what kind of advice to give her about the ""correct"" amount of macros. 

Should I just tell her what I do, and pretty much what the sidebar says for losing weight? Or would yall suggest I tell her something different, because her goal is different than mine? 

Any advice would be appreciated, even if ya tell me to just read the sidebar haha"

"dude nice, happy that you looked into it. Let me know how you feel after the first week, I‚Äòm always super stoked to start a new program."
"I mean that‚Äôs sorta ok but here‚Äôs a better explanation 

So basically when doing an open chain movement (which is what most of weight lifting is)your just moving a limb that‚Äôs holding the weight while the body stays in place like a bicep curl or leg press.

And a closed chain movement( which is what most of calisthenics is) is when your point of contact stays the same but accept for your limb moving your moving your body threw space like a push up, pull up, and squat which tends to activate the muscle fibers more than a open chain movement, but open chain is still good to do."

I enjoy penguinz0/moistcritical depending on what channel you watch him on. Some of his videos are funny.
Im joking bro. You can drink as much as you would like to. Protein powder is a great tool for getting all of your protein in if you couldn‚Äôt make it with food or if the idea of eating chicken breast for the 700000th time just doesn‚Äôt seem appetizing. Good rule of thumb is .8 grams of protein per body weight. Atleast that‚Äôs what I follow and it‚Äôs served me well.

What in the beta cuck shit is this
"Lately I have been having trouble working out in the evening. I have always trained after work, starting my workout around 5 PM. Since about 2 months I have had trouble really feeling the muscles and getting a pump, usually on my chestdays. I have a decent mind-muscle connection but, like today, I just can not get mu chest to fire up. Even on the sets building up to the working weight my shoulders just take over and hurt. I have had lots of trouble with my shoulder, mainly the front delt and rotator cuff, due to an inexperienced trainer teaching me the basics when I started. I was wondering if anyone here has a standard desk 9-5 job (I work in IT, so I get little to no movement while working), has had a problem before and knew how to fix it. It might have something to do with the fact that I hit the gym straight from work and don‚Äôt take time to clear my head a little, but I‚Äôd love to hear your stories on this!"

At 160 I was stuck for the longest at 230-245 depending how i was feeling now at 175 am stuck at 265 but not a excuse but I have a torn labrum so benching for me is almost non existent once o twice a month.

If youre overeating youre not cutting. If youre missing your protein goal youre sacrificing gym performance and muscle. Up to you to decide which is worse
"Thanks. You gay, bro?"
Like others said you need more size for pro. You'd be much better off not cutting right now and using all the time you have while you're young to build a solid base. You're doing yourself no favors by doing practice shows instead of continuing growth.
Also idk if this happens to you too but my palms start to turn orange if I have a ton of carrots/sweet potatoes. Not a big issue but funny lol

True that does hold some water ‚Äúno pun intended‚Äù . But my meals are 100-200g of carbs . The first and last meal have 90% of my fat . And the protein is 30-50g per meal . So far my best days regarding digestion is when I strictly eat apples peanut butter and cereal and chicken lol

Chest is barely noticeable and only seen when u said. If conscious you will always spot it regardless. The only thing I can suggest is only do dumbbells and unilateral work, ditch the dips, barbell press press up and when your weaker side fails stop don't push until stronger side fails. That will help and concentrate on rear delts they help keep shoulders in neutral position and stops the rounding of shoulders"
"My dose is still relatively low. A lot of people don‚Äôt consider it a blast until 20/day and idk if I‚Äôll bother going that high if I‚Äôm not trying to bulk. 

However, it hasn‚Äôt affected me mentally nearly as much as tren, deca, or higher test. I don‚Äôt feel like the cocky sex god I did on deca or tren, but i do feel generally good (I have a history of depression, which deca definitely made worse). Again, part of me feel like it‚Äôs apples and oranges because the lowest I‚Äôve run tren or deca is 350/500 respectively."

I want to get as big as i can be without anabolics then when i cant make any good progress then take anabolics. So yeah thats why im not cutting right now and only cutting where further gains in fat would be needed . But damn 200lbs ‚Äúbulked‚Äù and 175-170lbs stage conditioning by January would be amazing!

"Thanks. I say that because I can tell I'm putting excess stress on joints, tendons, ligaments. I can feel tightness and inflammation in some of these areas so I'm being careful to focus more on form, while still doing enough weight to challenge me by doing higher reps more slowly. I don't think I'm being too cautious but rather safe than sorry. I don't have anyone to work out with. I slowly invested and cobbled together a little home gym, squat rack, bar, curl bar, some dumbbells and resistance bands, and 300lbs of weight

I feel like going for broke might set my training back. The only other time in my life where I actively lifted I remember really screwing up my shoulder and elbows. It set me back weeks and I just sort of gave up after that. I was running a basic strength program then."

Switching a ppl routine would just restart your pyramid (assuming you even have one) and throw the body further out of homeostasis, and you wouldn't be doing much because they're all the frickin same bro"

"Haha. I suppose you are right in this sense. 

However if you were to take the average joe shmoe, and put him on TRT doses of testosterone, he would 100% without a doubt make gains better than a natural, and he will be able to surpass his genetic limit even just by a little.

In that sense, it's long term PED use (probably for life), however it's a safe practice especially when under supervision by a doctor.

"Fitness industry is full of bullshit so you have to navigate it carefully to find the right information. The basics of bodybuilding are:

1. Progressive Overload 
2. Diet
3. Consistency 

Most people on here would follow a 6x/week workout split. Something like the Reddit PPL which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) is commonly recommended. If 6 days a week is too much, a U/L/P/P/L split can be used for 5x/week or a U/L/U/L for 4x a week. These are SPLITS. A split without progression is NOT a program. A program has some sort of progression design. Without progression, it‚Äôs gonna be hard to build muscle and become a muscular freak of nature. Get in the gym with a plan, stick to it and work hard. Bodybuilding is a marathon not a sprint. 

On diet, you gotta eat if you want to grow. But you don‚Äôt wanna eat *too* much. A caloric surplus of 300-500 calories over your maintenance calories is generally appropriate, but everyone is different and you‚Äôll have to adjust your calories as needed. Track your weight everyday in the morning as soon as you wake up, and take the average of the week. You want to be gaining around 1lb per week, a little less/more is okay especially as a novice. Around here we generally recommend 1g protein per 1lb of your body weight. For fats, 0.3g/lb of body weight is sufficient for hormonal balance. Fill the rest of your needed calories with carbs. Eat 50-75% of your carbs around workout times if you are able as they fuel your workouts. This can seem like a ton of info to start with but if you need help with macros just send me a PM and we can figure it out. You should be getting majority of your calories from whole food if possible. No supplements are truly necessary, but a protein powder like whey or a vegan powder can be helpful to fill in gaps. Whole food provide the micronutrients your body needs to function. MyProtein is popular here and they are always running huge sales. Check them out. 

That‚Äôs about it. Tried to keep it informative and shortish."

Consistency and hard work man. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing and just push yourself. 90% of bodybuilding is patience. You look very well developed as is and you can only progress from there. Keep it up!
"Yeah I‚Äôve been meaning to tell you you can take the guest bedroom, no one uses it anyway"
Thank you. It‚Äôs my peace sign
"Well yeah I agree there will be potentially large variance from individual to individual. But I did not ask anyone to prescribe me a generic peak week protocol nor did I ask what the best peak week was. I am just interested in hearing what strategies worked and did not for different individuals.  Just like tips on training, supplements and diet you can take ideas and try strategies from others without blindly copying the entire protocol."
Yeah for 2 seconds. Big letdown
Damn looking great man
"If you have a shitty day, I hate to say it, but it‚Äôs kinda on you. So, you know shit happens and we go through shit, but you just gotta work through it. Keep pushing forward, don‚Äôt let anything fucking bring you down"
Wow. Thanks for the info. I feel like that must be really frustrating to get to that point and know you will never get gold next to another guy that just won the genetic lottery :/
Completely agree! You can only keep bulking for so long. As you bulk you constantly need to adjust your maintenance calories and it gets to a point where pushing further into a bulk gets harder and harder. Cutting back for a couple months as a ‚Äúreset‚Äù is super beneficial and will allow you to bulk further next time

Hi my friends, I‚Äôm a 19yo that‚Äôs been going to the gym for a few years now. I am pretty content with my body, with the exception of my triceps which are lacking compared to the rest of my body.

I broke my left elbow as a child and it didn‚Äôt heal properly. My elbow clicks as a result of my injury to this day, it‚Äôs pretty painful. I feel like I lose a lot of my strength when it happens. 

The only tricep exercise I have been doing consistently without problem is the tricep cable pull down. I have tried tricep extensions and it‚Äôs absolute hell for me. I also have problems with closer gripped bench press and closer gripped pushups. 

TLDR: Broke my elbow. It healed Funny. Can only do cable pull downs without my elbow going crazy. Do you have any recommendations on workouts I can possibly do/try? 

Thanksüôè"

" Has anyone here encountered a serious plateau when it comes to putting on lean muscle mass, and how did they get past it?

I've gone from 160 lbs in March 2020 at 25% BF down to 126 lbs at 7.4% BF in October 2021. I wanted to do a slow bulk since then and have gained steadily at a pace of 2 lbs a month.

My routine is pretty intense, I run almost 20 miles a week and lift every day except for 1 off day. I'm sore after my lifts, and I've been steadily increasing my lifts for the first time in what feels like 3 years. I let my diet slip for about 5 weeks in Jan/Feb where I wasn't tracking (except for making sure I got enough protein), but otherwise I aim for only a 2-300 calorie surplus each day.

All this being said, I have literally only put on fat since reaching my lowest weight in October 2020. It's pretty damn depressing but I feel like I have to accept this base of muscle is all my body is capable of supporting. Has anyone managed to significantly increase their muscle mass after 5-6 years of training?

"Piggy backing off this. Some of the best friends I‚Äôve made have been in the gym. Talk to some of the regulars. Ask a question or two. Before you know it, you have friends just as crazy about the sport as you. As for a girlfriend, finding one that exercises would be ideal but it doesn‚Äôt have to be the case. Just find a girl that respects that you want to be a better version of yourself and has at least one goal for improving herself as well- whether that‚Äôs education or work or creative expression, whatever. 
Also, sure it might become a personality trait for a while but eventually you‚Äôll find your gym mentality seeping over into other areas of life. Eventually you‚Äôll be more known as a confident and driven individual rather than a gym douche, but the gym douche step is a pretty common stepping stone.
Also, I‚Äôm sorry about your friend OP. I‚Äôm happy you used something like the gym to cope rather than any number of harmful things you could‚Äôve fallen into."
"Best budget EAAs?

  I don't need them to be flavored"
Are there any supplements actually worth it?
"Achy, not itchy. I'm just aching all the time I'm out of the gym. It's like this constant ache all over my body, mainly the shoulder area. But it leaves me irritable and in a bad mood all the time."
Thanks Lanky-Run!
"I'm a fan of his YouTube channel. He was an excellent champion as Mr O. You did well! Good for you bro! Any others on the horizon for you, or you calling it for the rest of this season?"
How important is MMC for bodybuilding?
"I actually really like going to the gym, even if it's busy I would work around it or take my time. I only ever see the same 8-10 people at work so the stimulation is nice. But I work 2-10pm now and winters in the midwest are brutal.

I bought a house and spent $1800 dollars and bought a power rack with cable attachments and man, it's so easy lifting now. Takes 45 minutes what would take over 1h15m at a gym. I can wake up, walk 30 seconds to it, fold my laundry in between sets, etc. Pretty solid choice"
"Hahah funnily enough this was the process I had in my mind originally but was like ‚Äúuuhhh maybe not‚Äù

Edit: the one plus is money not such a problem for us (praise the music gods)  the bigger problem is tour buses lack decent cooking facilities"
"There's a program I want to run that has a five or six day option (three days¬†PPL with two or three pump days). My schedule won't allow me to train six days a week, but I still wanted to run the six day option to hit all bodypart pump days. Would it work alright for me to follow the order of the days, but add in an off day when necessary?"
"She‚Äôs definitely gained muscle in her arms compared to how slender she was before. I mean, she‚Äôs the new Thor so of course she‚Äôs gained weight."
Sounds like you still haven't pulled heavy
Idk if gymshark does lined shorts and I feel like their stuff is kinda cheaply made
Haha it‚Äôs rough cutting this much weight over and over. I‚Äôll just get down to a baseline hopefully by the end of the year and then lean bulk

"Oh shit someone actually seeing my ig lol.

Thanks! Yeah still about 3 more weeks til i start prep and cutting more cals I'm only at like a 150 cal deficit rn and off everything. 

This prep is gonna be a bit of experimenting since I'm in a new weight class and so many people qualify for nationals so I can take more risks and not worry as much."

Posted a few days ago saying my friend was trying to convince me to go to an EDM festival with him but I wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to. People were saying they‚Äôre a blast and holy shit that might be the most fun I‚Äôve ever had in my life
"Very hard! Practice breathing through your chest and keeping your core tight. One easy way to find someone locally‚Äîfind out who the promoter of your show is, contact them and they will more than likely be able to connect you with some people. The promoter wants people to have a good experience and ultimately come back, and having a good experience means being prepared."
"Just trying to be funny (not that good at it). I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it doe, if that‚Äôs all you have maybe just skip it and eat more food but I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm just a hobbyist."
For sure.  One of the tell tale signs.  Got to dial in the estro.
"I pretty much never used them up to a few months ago.  My joints are pretty beat up both from my lifting and my old job.  Most is probably from the job, but either way, lifting without support didn't make my joints ""wear and tear-proof"" like I hoped. I think it just contributed to it.

Now that I don't need to regularly use strength/athleticism outside the gym, I use support and feel much, much better. Probably should have done so all along, and if I go back to that job, I'm going to keep training with them."

"Why should he have to stop his set when he literally just said, ""Guys can you not do that shit over here"" and he could have carried on his set normal, but they started mouthing off at him. Yeah his response wasn't great, but he is a human. Just because he is in the public eye, doesn't mean everything he does has to be perfect"

It's mainly the lighting but also the bad old SD video sharpened up with filters that we have to compare to todays HD material. If they'd stand side by side on the same stage filmed with the same HD cameras those supposed differences would disappear.
That was totally worth my time clicking and reading it. Best post March 2021 award.
You can do whatever the hell you want if you manage your recovery
Cant let you be the only entertainment in the sub lmao
It‚Äôs been helping me tho. My mums sugar level is lower and she feels full most of the day so she doesn‚Äôt crave snacks which raise her sugar levels
You don't think I have worked hard? You don't think I'm working hard?
"If you have trouble getting calories in then yea, any mass gainer will help. Add in a tbs of evoo for some extra cals too."

Yes
Isn‚Äôt everyone like this? In my country very few people are religious but most people still celebrate and have family over for diner
"Yeah probably, wouldn't be first time it's happened and neither will it be the last. He's been in condition before in classic, so it's not just him being genetically predisposed to really holding onto water and fat. Maybe it's because he hasn't filled out the class yet and is worried about bring outsized if he comes in shredded, maybe he cheats on diet, maybe it's something else entirely, but either way when someone comes in soft to every show I assume they won't be coming in hard anytime soon. Like c'mon man, this really the best condition you can bring to the Olympia?"

Good luck with your peak"
"Haha thanks!  Sunscreen before going outside; AHA face peel 2x a year, vitamin C &amp; hyaluronic  acid day serum in morning and retinol face moisturizer at night?  I also think just lifting weights and staying fit in general makes you look younger overall"

"lmao yea man, it was their egos that got in the way and not the random dude coming up to them asking how much they bench being offputting and weird. maybe they went out just to hang out with each other so being by themselves was fine? maybe theyre gay and enjoyed each others company more? sounds more like your ego is the one thats getting in the way"
Stop feeling guilty about things you can‚Äôt change. Talk to a therapist. Find a way to make yourself feel better because you‚Äôll be way more stressed if you‚Äôre broke and jobless.
"Thanks man! Glad to hear yours has gone. Only started up in the last month or so, so I'm not too worried. Doing a de-load week, wearing an elbow sleeve when lifting, having an ice pack on, and doing stretches every few hours, hoping it'll slowly heal with some careful lifting."

"Absolutely agree. I thought I went too far but holy shit dude, you're supposed to stay somewhat aesthetic not ""first time in the gym since high school""."
Yeah well there's no subreddit for it so it shouldn't come as a surprise to the guy 2 comments up that not everyone here is a fan of mass monsters either.
Yes! Best gym in the west!
"I feel you. I get like this recently a lot too with a lot of work related stress. I don‚Äôt _want_ to do anything but if I don‚Äôt shit keeps piling up. The key for me is to prioritize the list, then make deals with yourself. Force myself to put away laundry and change the sheets, then rest and fuck around on my phone or nap for a bit. Repeat. 

That way you‚Äôre still getting the most important stuff done but you‚Äôre also listening to your body go ‚Äúfuck man I just want to rest‚Äù. You might not get to everything today but if you prioritized it right, the stuff skipped can be done tomorrow without any consequence."
ill bring the candles xx

IMPORTANT QUESTION does anyone have any pics of what a vacuum looks like with a cervical/extra rib

"Joplin as a town seems very very nice and like a place I‚Äôd want to live in as well, my high school coach used to live in Abilene and didn‚Äôt like it that much.


I am a Christian which is partly why I looked into Abilene but I know I can still find a church to attend or drum for in or near Joplin. The coach at Abilene is very a faithful man but I can‚Äôt base my decision solely off that because money still is something I have to consider, if they even the money out then it‚Äôll be a very difficult decision but i doubt they can lower the cost by so much since the average total cost without financial aid is 50k vs MSSU at 15k"
"So I found out the hard way that my body reacts terrible to nair. I used it almost 3 weeks ago, and the back side of my hams and glutes look like a minefield of pimples/bumps where there was previously not even one. Maybe this is the universe's way of telling me to stay hairy."

"I work 7:30-4:00, gym at 4 a.m. and i love it, personally. There's usually 4 or 5 cars there when i get there, all the equipment is typically open until about 5 when i'm wrapping my workout up. I never have to fight over equipment, i get to come home and shower, eat and read before work. Good start to the day."
I hope so

Very good start brother. Keep after it and good luck on the prep
"legs and butt weak, face busted"
"If you care, maybe post a pic or two tomorrow, or in your next update, pinching your belly skin fold. It's hard to gauge due to your posture &amp; body hair.

Like [this](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/woman-pinching-her-belly-picture-id467912530)

and a second if you want, [vertical](https://www.brianmac.co.uk/pictures/body%20fat/abdomen.jpg) (this is the best pic i could find, the guy is obviously extremely lean. just try and take a picture doing the same pinch as the first horizontal one, but instead vertically, and the spot to center on is @1.5-2"" to one side of the belly button like the man in the picture)

Also, a shot of your thighs relaxed/flexed always helps, but you're gonna continue the cut anyway so no big deal.

Congratulations on &gt;10lbs man, keep grinding away at it. I think you can see it in your shoulders, your triceps are looking leaner, your arms are looking a bit bigger overall which is impressive. Initially I was wondering where you lost 11lbs- but check the relaxed ribcage, and relaxed upper back. Congrats, you're absolutely making noticeable progress; it's just hard to see due to body hair, and ... I don't know what I'm talking about ... but it looks like your fat distribution is pretty even, which I assume is a positive thing physique-wise. I don't know what before/after of your gut looks like in a side profile. I was expecting to see more noticeable loss around your waist line.

If you feel like you're not making progress don't fool yourself- for me, various body parts leaned out at different rates- and for you, I think a lot of fat has been coming off your back (which is hard to appreciate in the mirror everyday(: ). Don't forget thighs &amp; butt hold a lot too (I lost @15lbs, my butt went from 38.2"" &gt; 35.5"" &amp; thighs 22"" &gt; 21"". I never would've noticed the butt if I hadn't taken measurements). Good work &amp; Keep at it man, I hope you're feeling good about the process"
Thanks for the reply mate I‚Äôll check it out ü§ôüèº
"That makes sense. Yes I‚Äôm about 300g‚Äôs protein per day (150 from chicken, 100 isolate PP, 50 lean beef, plus some from PB). I‚Äôm on keto prep so there‚Äôs not a lot of variety so I wasn‚Äôt sure if they help there. Thanks."
By better meant they like his physique more not that he could beat ramy in comp
now that's a good physique it's missing some mass but it flows very well and it's very defined all i can say is good luck this is an award winning physique
"I meant lifting. I like both powerlifting and bodybuilding on each of my chest, back and leg days"
"Yes, you'll be fine"
Anyone reading anything good?
Some would say he murdered that year
Agreed. It‚Äôs not that appropriate volume isn‚Äôt important or that high volume doesn‚Äôt work. But I‚Äôd say a lot of people at commercial gyms are doing way too many sets at too little intensity. Just aimlessly going from machine to machine with weights that are not anywhere challenging enough.
First actual good physique I have seen posted here
"Men with tits aren‚Äôt shredded everywhere else, let alone 90% of their pecs"
I'm shocked but I'm not surprised either. Especially with his health history. You shouldnt be downvoted. I'm only 5 years younger. I blast more than i cruise. I'm taking stock in my life today.
"Yeah, it doesn't quite taste exactly like ranch but its pretty tasty. It's totally a thing people do but its not for everybody. I like it because ranch is like 150 calories of mostly fat for 2 tablespoons, whereas I can have as much greek yogurt ranch as I want without worrying about fucking up my macros."
"They're all dumb when they come from the equivalent of ""addict logic""  


But really ask yourself is there anything you say no to? There is you are just not aware of it cause are you are not into it. Something which was really good for you too...

Yes females are humans but they have alot less testosterone so they can't build muscle as well as guys and carry more body fat.

Alright. Thanks for the help man.
Most other dudes just probably got uglier
"I think I've read a realistic number is a 3-5% increase in strength during a 12 week block when training for strength, assuming good form and you're past beginner stage. So, realistically going from 485 to 660# is likely a process that will take a couple years. If you're adding PED's I have no idea how that would affect things, no experience in that area."
Lol

Zoom in on his face in both pics lol
Yeah that's the main thing that sucks is the cardio required. Especially something like boxing. But I love bodybuilding the most and feel like it would be best to prioritize that. Thanks!
Looks strange with a top like that but nothing on legs

"They're smart in certain areas. Like exercise science, those guys are sharp af. But being smart in one thing doesn't make you all around smart. My old neighbor was amazing with computers but thought Bill Gates was the devil trying to microchip us with the vaccine bc it says so in the Bible"
Holy shit man that conditioning is outrageous. He‚Äôs gonna place high I‚Äôm saying top 3
"Thing is, my question is more like, can i achieve that weight? Currently I‚Äôm like 170 and have been working out like 2 years but can i be 200 lbs at a reasonable bodyfat%

Obviously I wont win 30 lbs of pure muscle, but between whatever muscle i can still gain naturally, muscle maturity, glycogen and maybe some fluff, is it reasonable for a 5‚Äô9‚Äù to be 200lbs lean?"
"Yes I know, but he uses it to emphasize that you don't have to get fat on a 1000 calorie surplus on a bulk."

Going to have to get with someone on this or start going to the seminars."
"I'm planning on seriously bulking up like putting on massive mass. I have one dilemma though. 

If I were to do cardio. And let's say I burn 300 calories. 

In order for the cardio to not deter my bulk, do I just eat 300 more calories? 

I want to have good stamina too and that's why I want to do a bit of cardio atleast in my bulking up process."

"I see both.  Plenty of repetitive debate on protein amounts, timing etc."
so why should I do a slow cut If I can burn much more fat like this in a small period? and why people aren't doing this instead of a slow cut?

Wrong sub
"So for a list of controversial olympias there would be the 1971 Olympia, which Arnold won by default since all other competitors were disqualified. 

Then there was the 1980 Olympia, which Arnold showed up at unexpectedly, while filming a documentary and being friends with the judges. Arnold wasn't at his best and many say he didn't deserve this win. 

The 1981 Olympia is also very controversial, Franco Columbu won it with one torn quad that was significantly smaller than the other. In my opinion 1981 is more controversial than 1980. 

The 1994 is also sometimes sighted as being controversial especially by Shawn ray fans. The say Dorian should've lost because of his torn bicep. 

The 1997 Olympia is also very controversial, pose for pose many would argue that Nasser el Sonbaty won that one. 

The 2001 Olympia is also controversial, 28 year old Jay Cutler was more conditionned than Ronnie Coleman. Even Ronnie at the night show thought that he had lost. 

The 2007 is also one of the most controversial, pose for pose Victor Martinez seems to have beaten Jay Cutler, but Cutler still had the win. 

The 2014 Olympia is one of the lesser controversial ones, many think Kai Greene should've won. Phil had a disgusting gut that year as well. 

And then 2018 seems to be controversial as well, but meh. Also some think Hadi should've won the 2019 Olympia. That's about it really for Mr Olympia contest at least."
That's a pretty considerable difference there

"Embarrassing question: When I'm pushing myself at the gym, I fart a lot. This normally isn't an issue, because I'm typically the only one in it when I work out, but occasionally there will be someone in there and I can't help myself. It just comes out. I have tried releasing all the gas prior to a work out, but still occasionally a fart will come out uncontrollably. Is there something I should be doing differently to prevent this?"

Lol. I just got one of those little pod systems for now. Like a juul but you can fill it with whatever. Gonna try and keep it that way if I can.
Really dumb question but I‚Äôve been lifting for some years now and haven‚Äôt kept my protein high at all. Usually 130g a day when I‚Äôm weighing 180s. Just wondering the potential this had to limit my progress and if bumping it to 200 would result in some nice gains
Better than being small though amirite

When cutting I don't need to try and stimulate growth, just maintain. This means I can run much less aggressive programming, lower the volume, increase the intensity and work on realizing strength gains. 

This was none of my time is wasted and I'm always progressing something, I almost don't think of it as cutting. It's a strength block, which just happens to be a convinient time to cut weight."
"He‚Äôs had problems with his conditioning every year since he went pro, although he‚Äôs made improvements almost every year for the O. I think people handicap him a bit because of it."
I'd hope not. Just wouldn't want to miss on some sick gains but tbh It's prolly gonna be insignificant. Thanks

"This is misinformation and overblown. For healthy people (obviously if you have chronic knee problems, they can be bad for you, but they can also help you heal), doing leg extensions properly puts almost no tension on the joint, and lights the VM up, which is just what we want. However, if you apply shear force to your knees, bounce the weight, etc., obviously you can hurt yourself."
"Agreed, Chris won in 2019 solely based off of structure. Breon had him beat practically every shot muscle group for muscle group. Giving Chris the win was more so a statement from the judges on the direction classic physique was going, not a dominant win"

"Was severely under eating.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äù6 and weight 185-189lbs normally and was only I taking around 1800-1900 calories a day, yet was lifting 5x a week as well as conducting 45-60 minute cardio 3-4x a week.

Spoke with my local dietician, figured my macros correctly and upped my caloric intake to 2800-3000 a day depending on the intensity for training and sure enough I got stronger on all my lifts, improved my run speed and endurance, and am currently still losing body fat while maintaining current weight.

180-200g of protein, 60-80g of fat, and 250-300g of carbs a day."
Yep. Feels like you know the bad day session is gonna require that extra effort so you're able to find it. Opposite for the good day
If it helps you mentally then go for it. I've never had an issue maintaining a deficit but I naturally have a lower appetite. I struggle with bulking

"The point of drinking a protein shake is that it digests quickly. Adding fats slows down the digestion which prevents you from getting in your other meals and if you‚Äôre already eating an adequate amount of fats from your diet you aren‚Äôt getting much of a benefit out of adding more fats. You‚Äôre just getting fatter. You‚Äôre better off adding carbs to your shakes, something that digests quickly like dextrose. Carbs will actually help with your performance unlike fats."

"Idk if that makes sense.  To me a DL bar feels harder to bounce because the rebound when it hits the ground is actually more pronounced than a stiff bar.  The DL bar wants to snap back to the ground while a stiff bar doesn't whip at all, making it easier to bounce.  

Since it's still easier to pull from a dead stop than a stiff bar, which seems to be the best of both worlds for volume sets.  I can TnG without as much cheating, and when I do need to rest for a moment on the ground, it's easier to finish the set."
Post contest how many cheat meals do you usually have? Night of? 24hrs? What diet do you normally switch back to? Something similar to a couple weeks out and then reverse diet back up to an offseason?

I've seen people struggle with bloating and water retention when deep into a cut/bulk. Fiber will help lessen that.
"Easiest way to get rid of bloating and water weight? Scale is fucking with me this cut, up by 1 kg these past couple days even though im 100% sure i was in a deficit."

Years ago, I went to the Arnold Classic with some buddies and we all wore our Mountain Dog Training sweatshirts.

We took out our phones and snapped a pic and then he surprised us and took out HIS phone for a picture of us all. That stuck with me. 

Well, a year or two later, I accepted a job working at EliteFTS in London. My first time out there training in the old S4 compound, John rolls in and glances at me and goes ‚ÄúHEY! I remember you.‚Äù I was shocked. He whipped out his phone and scrolled through the pictures and found pic from years prior. 

I had the pleasure of training with him and learning from him for 3 years or so. The man truly was as honest, kind, and hard working as portrayed. He was a true gentleman and I will miss him greatly."

I don‚Äôt stop using reddit but I delete and recreate my account because I post pics of myself and maybe give away personal info etc over time so I‚Äôve just made it a habit
Watched his YouTube videos. He done so well but when he went to the show for pro card he was conditioned to hell but the head judge said to him after he needs 15-20 pounds of muscle added.  He done the right thing he‚Äôs not messing about.  When he does get his pro card he wants to be able to stand with the pros.  In his show last week where he won his category and then overall he dominated but when he went to Ukraine for pro he definitely looked smaller than the guy he lost to but had the conditioning.  He will go far for sure.
"Got to factor in how much more difficult it gets to look filled out, the taller you get."

One of the best training videos on YT IMO
RDLs are great I also smashed split squats and bought resistance bands to do hamstring curls
Wait how many calories is that? Seems low and 20g fat seems too low.

Any tips here? Currently eating 3500 calories avg"
"I do take the safety argument and especially for pro bodybuilders it's important not to get injured, but I'm not sure about the ""easier to isolate"" point. Pretty much every gym these days has a wide variety of isolation machines and I'm sure most people consciously mix freeweights and isolation machines in their training. Not saying it doesn't work. If pros do it, it must work, but I'm not sure if it is optimal."
That‚Äôs going to be awkward.
100% agree
"You can switch however you like. However, I‚Äôve found the best order for recovery is Pull, Push, Legs, Off. This way you can hit Pull and Legs without any lower back fatigue interfering with either session."

"I‚Äôm not on IG, so appreciate this! Nice work!"
"Has anyone here tried multiple bulk and cut cycles from and to the same weights? Basically whenever you cut you end up at the same weight and eventually get leaner and leaner at that weight the more bulk and cut cycles you do, vice versa for bulking. Im at a not fat not lean 81.4 kg rn, thinking of bulking slowly to 83 kg then cutting to 80 and repeating multiple times. Should i increase that range or is it good?"
That true

Lol nieghbor
I can handle a loss no problem so no worries there. I appreciate the honest feedback. And idk why I look so bad in these pictures I have plenty of other ones where I look much better. Maybe I was way too pumped since I took these after a workout cause I heard too that can take away from the look as well.
There is no way to give an even remotely accurate estimation.
I'm likely miscounting honestly but I've also been pretty depressed. Gonna try to pull myself out of the dip &amp; go from there. I'll definitely hyu on Instagram if I still am not losing after I dig myself out. Thank you!

His are much more bodybuilding focused tho."
"The confirmation is in the math lol. Considering 61 grams of protein only accounts for 244 calories, I can believe it. Compare that to lean protein like chicken breast where at least 75% of the calories will come from protein. It probably has a ton of fat if it's anything like the Rotisserie Chicken at Harris Teeter, but I'll be damned if it doesn't taste great."
"That article is retarded. Climbing requires strong as fuck legs as does rowing... Why would someone primarily use arm strength when you have these massive quad muscles to push you up when you have the grip?

How stupid would it be to train the day after getting my wisdom teeth out?
No you can't
"So, I just mimicked trap raises and trap retractions without using weight, and I think the ROM is the same.. I mean, once the mid/lower traps ""meet"" each other and push against each other in the center of the back, they can't get more contracted than this, and this can be achieved by horizontal shrugs/retraction.. 

I trust you on the emg activity tho. 

And yes, I wasn't planning to toss out compound exercises, but I'm thinking to include a heavy horizontal shrug instead of doing 3-4 row variations"

I'll try man.  I'm sorry you had a bad experience.  Your contributions to the sub help improve it and I will continue to try my best to make improvements.  Thanks!
Well played. Although people like her should be straight up kicked from the gym.
"Fucking Rocky Balboa over here super setting 10x100 calf extensions on the leg press and time on the punching bag ruined my morning. I went through pyramid set squats, leg extensions, leg curls, calf raises and the motherfucker was still going on that leg press with a whopping 25 pound llate on each side. Whatever, i'm out. Hope you guys get a better pump than i do lmao."
So barbell upright row would be a good addition I suppose?

"That's awesome! Good work man. That's a great plan for sure, if I was still at a gym I'd consider running it. I loved Creeping Death.

Just keep going man, you're looking solid for sure. Adding more mass and time to your frame means you're well on your way."

"Not how it works for a lot people with loose skin. Have you not seen pics of folk who‚Äôve lost an impressive amount of weight and are now very lean, but still have a lot of loose skin? There are tonnes out there. I think a lot of people resign themselves to surgery at that point but if it‚Äôs relatively minor amount of loose skin like the OP appears to have then it does seem possible to improve through diet/training etc"

"something that I would recommend for all you new guys that have started lifting is to take more pictures at the gym with your gym partners. I ever really only had only two serious gym partner. One from almost 4 years ago and the most recent one from 1 and a 1/2 years ago, and it‚Äôs a good feeling looking back at those photos that we have together. maybe being part of the military and always pcsing and deploying"

"I agree with you about the night thing, but I just moved and changed gyms, and it‚Äôs just insanely crowded at night, such that it doubles my workout time because I spend so much time waiting to use a rack/ machine. So now I lifting in the morning during the week, and it can be a slog, especially for stuff like deads. 

Once I‚Äôm warmed up and an exercise or two in, though, I‚Äôm feeling good and don‚Äôt notice the hunger until I‚Äôm back home. It‚Äôs made eating way easier on bulk because I‚Äôm hungrier throughout the day, and my appetite is absolute garbage."
in the grand scheme of things i don't think it can't be **THAT** bad. Subtracting 5 years off of your life isn't a big deal and most people who do SARMS will migrate to gear anyways after spending the equivalent of a vial of primo for 1/26th of the gains
"I love almond milk with sugary cereals, I find it actually tastes better than with normal milk. Apart from that I tend to prefer normal milk.

Same! Thank you
"But long term wise you're doing more damage to your hormones. Hopping on gear isn't advised unless 1. You've hit you're complete genetic limit and 2 everything else about your diet and training is perfect.

Amazing shape and flow. The higher lat inserts with how round/full they are look great. Same with the arms. Hopefully he comes in dialled proper for the next show so we can see him in his best.

Diet is pretty much the same every day. Very rarely do I eat fried foods or oil. We usually cook with a wok or an air fryer that uses almost no oil to cook foods. I eat a *lot* of asparagus, which leans you out as well. I have asparagus 4-5 days a week. 

After a full day of eating though, like when it's bed time, my waist will have stretched 1-2""."

"I'm gonna be honest, I thought my  cal was low enough  on fitnespal so I didn't measure the ice cream with an actual cup until last 2 weeks. I re-measured all my food again on myfitnesspal and now that you mentioned it, the ice cream is 3/4 cups for 180 calories which is so fuckin little if i only eat 80 calories of that 

anyways, thanks I messed up on the icream part, just decided to add oats since that tastes pretty good and filling instead of binging on ice cream"

"To steal the tactic from J. Kenji L√≥pez-Alt - measure out your pasta in the pot. Put enough water to just cover the pasta. Put over heat. When the water reaches 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82.2 Celsius), start the timer for your particular pasta to be cooked. Time ends, mix in your milk and cheese with the remains of the starch filled pasta water, over low heat. This would also be an advantageous time to out some additional seasonings (garlic powder, chili flakes, black pepper). Boom - one pot and ideally not super stuck to the bottom Mac and cheese"

And Phil Heath was winning over Ramy. 5‚Äô6 Dexter has won the Olympia and the Arnold Classic 5 times, over taller competitors. 5‚Äô6 Roelly Winklaar has won over taller competitors. However, the height thing is relative. Taller competitors like Cedric McMillian tend to dominate over others, because they may have better genetics.

I finished my cut last week and went away on vacation for a week. I go home tomorrow but my weight is up 8 lbs. 121 to 129 currently.  I know lots is probably bloat from carbs and sugar but has this happened to anyone? Usually after a cheat day it jumps 5 lbs for a few days and goes back down but I've never been up this high for this long. Kinda freaking out"

"I've been thinking about conspiracy theories and I think I've come up with a psychological reason why so many of them are so prevent. 

Because absurd theories are more logical then the events that spawned them. Certain moments like 911 and jfks assasination are so beyond comprehension and so tragic the only way people know how to deal with them is to craft wild stories and connect dots that aren't there. Because it's easier to accept that the government itself came up with the idea vs a few average men
 
For example like norman mailer said about jfk

*It is virtually not assimilable to our reason that a small lonely man felled a giant in the midst of his limousines, his legions, his throng and his security. If such a nonentity destroyed the leader of the most powerful nation on earth, then a world of disproportion engulfs us, and we live in a universe that is absurd.*

"Yes and no.

So first, lifting absolutely helps my mental health. It gives me focus and has generally enhanced my life and sense of wellbeing.

It is, however, absolutely not a true fix for real mental health problems. It is, at most, one piece of the mental health puzzle. At worst, it can increase a mental health issue either through body dysmorphia or such single minded focus that you lose sight of everything else.  In the middle, it can act as a bandaid.

I think lifting is a great hobby and I encourage everyone do participate, but it won't fix underlying issues."
I've tried it from rich piana and it has to have some actual performance enhancing stuff in it. My shoulders broke out and my dick stopped working while I used it when I was 100% natural so be careful with what you buy.
"Longer rest times is just going to stress your cns even more since you're more recovered between sets lol.

Don't delude yourself, the massive amounts of drugs those guys are on is insanely dangerous. They've been abusing for decades. It's just a matter of time until it hits people.

"Don‚Äôt touch gear for a few years I‚Äôd go crazy trying to see what you can naturally accomplish and then with gear the sky is the limit. Also, the idea that you make the most gains the first year isn‚Äôt always true. I trained and dieted like shit my first three years. Then was intense (1g protein per lb BW and trained 6 days a week hard af) and put on 15 lbs of muscle in my fourth year of training (I‚Äôd say 20-25 lbs of BW, 15 lb muscle is conservative as I didn‚Äôt gain too much fat, look leaner if anything). All I did was go all in on my diet, train caffeinated, and hopped on creatine. Make sure everything‚Äôs on point and you see how far you can go."
Hope he didn't ask Ronnie to do a vacuum

I think part of the problem is that people who don't understand a subject tend to have the strongest opinions about the subject in question and social media gives us access to those shit opinions. Couple that with more and more Boomers getting comfortable with tech and social media and here we are.
"Ok wait: basically what you're telling me is that running arimidex to lower overall estrogen levels (I know as said tren nor win don't aromatise) produced by my female body is OK and is no way what doesn't make my scale go down. In fact I take adex to lower my OWN estrogen which may cause water retention not bc of the gear I am on.

My coach told me if you drink once a week but do more cardio than you do which should be at least 20 mins every day (every workout end and not barely twice a week like you do) 2 glasses of wine won't screw up a  good diet, gear and workout regime -- obviously 1 bottle of rum could.
Luckily enough I immediately can adjust as it's 6th day.

Do you anyway think adex should be eliminated or a low dosage adex help with my own estrogen production? Or it is better to use it as the prep is going to be over?"

"Strongman lifting doesn't use many bodybuilding movements so unless they start following a bb program, they won't really get a bodybuilders physique. And they might look good, but they wont look nearly as good as an actual experienced bodybuilder on gear following a program.

As for the fat aspect, imo, strongmen eat a fuck ton and don't really care what they gain, fat or muscle, it's all leverage for them, so they'd have a bit of a curve adjusting to the stricter dieting I'd say. 

Now I kind of get the feeling you're talking about yourself, I recommend you don't use gear unless you have a coach for bodybuilding and a very good grasp on how hypertrophy, recovery, and food all work for bodybuilding, because you likely will not get very far without a coach and good guidance. If you decide you want to cycle with none of these things, do not take an oral only cycle, or any other compound without testosterone as the base, it won't work very well and will fuck your kidneys and livers into oblivion"
"Still, is it worth it?"
"I would care! Haha 

Yeah I‚Äôd report the guy."

"The number doesn't matter. 15 or 16 or 20 % bf. There is no point arguing about the percent. The judges aren't going to measure you with calipers or a DEXA scan.

"I feel ridiculous even asking this but how do you get bigger outer quad muscles... I've been squatting for years and I definitely notice my teardrops are getting bigger but that outer muscle that often sticks out... I feel like are non-existent on me. I'm a home gym guy so I don't have tons of different things to work with but maybe it's my variations. I ran nSuns for like a year and a half and was doing hella front squats (which I love), low bar squats. I always forget if you want a closer stance or wider stance to hit those."
Great separation on your quads! Super impressive cut
No it's a thoracic cage deformity.  If he wasn't carrying all that muscle it would be very pronounced.
"His back isn‚Äôt his strongest spot, and lacks some separation in his legs, obviously, but man, a little more time and this dude is going to be a monster in the division.  I personally like his structure more than laureus.  Classic is going to continue to blow up!"

"I've said this before and got shit on but yeah. There isn't a single sport in the world where you are at your weakest on comp day. For bodybuilders, your strength, speed or stamina makes no difference, and hypothetically if someone could somehow suck out all their fat and make something like synthol move and flex in a way that is visually indistinguishable from legitimate muscle, they could compete with the biggest and best bodybuilders without training at all.

I am of the opinion that bodybuilding is one of the most brutal things you can do to yourself, it requires all-in dedication 24/7 for years, you gotta train right, you gotta eat right, you gotta pin right every single day. But it is absolutely not a sport."

"It's good in a sense that I can take walks in my underwear; I can give small children the middle finger. But as long as I look happy while I'm doing it, people just assume I'm senile.... Well, sometimes I give small children the middle finger and don't realize I'm doing it until someone slaps me, so I really am going senile."
Nice physique bro.
Yeah I sometimes feel that the sub is improving but then most posts are flooded with crap comments and/or mostly meme responses that have stopped being funny 5 years ago.
"???

Can u just be nice"
"Lmao it‚Äôs hilarious all the kids in this subreddit go off one picture and throw out steroid accusations like a bunch of know it all‚Äôs. Look at his other stage photos he has it‚Äôs not that hard to decide if he could be a lifetime natty or not, Jfc. Guys act like people with amazing genetics can‚Äôt do this and that kids in puberty don‚Äôt develop gyno. Soooo pathetic‚Ä¶"
"yes, sorry, 200 grams per lb of bodyweight and at 100kg you're looking at 220 * 200 so 44,000 grams AKA 44 Kilos of protein per day minimum."

"Is there an advantage to derek's clinic over any other random one, if they're not particularly liberal with the TRT?"
"Attainable? 8% if you have great genetics and every bit of your training, diet, rest, and recovery is on point; and you will lose a good bit of muscle cutting that low. Sustainable as a natty 12-15%

Which, let's be honest most people do bodybuilding to look good. Aesthetic in the pro or even amateur levels of bodybuilding isn't the same as aesthetic in every day life. If you can have decent muscle mass in the 12-15% bodyfat range your body is already more aesthetic than 95% of the population. Truth be told, very few women are in to the mass monsters with vascularity that looks like a roadmap because they are diced to the socks while being 50-100lbs over the weight their frame can naturally carry. Have good size and some abs and you're already a specimen. A personality outside of gymratopia helps. ;)"
No u
Yeah bro everyone on the subreddit for BODYBUILDING is just out here aspiring to look ‚Äònatural‚Äô. It amazes me that people THIS stupid actually exist.
Whats your diet like? I'm 6'4 but I always gain weight when I try weight lifting. Im on the heavier side (290lbs). Not in good shape
What you need to do is cut it with some greek yogurt
"You need to write an ebook detailing the hell out of exactly what you did and are currently doing. I'm dead serious.

/u/sandycockss sends me the best memes on instagram and I can confirm this is from twitter and reposted on IG
"Arms are huge.  Gonna be killer when you shred down, I'd work on that classic pose too if that's what you're going for. Good posing and you will win the show most likely assuming you're shredded.  Obviously you know this but backside and chest are the key points going forward IMO."
I missed it gimme a recap?
is there any proof he is natural
Arms look thick as hell in that front relaxed
Thanks man! Any durability issues? I always have problems with cheaper pairs getting sweat/rain in one ear and it plugs up when I run.
Hurt me please
What in the fuck lmao
Load times will probably be better with the top tier one
"I love this sub. Thankful that it‚Äôs still here in all its glory, you guys and gals are the best. Keep doing you."
"Maybe the fault lies with those shitting in a while division just because they don't like it and prefer a different one? If you don't like it, great, move on. It's all bodybuilding and that's why it's here."
"That sounds dope, happy for you"
They are neat. Kid came home with like 9 ribbons and did her first full speed barrel race so a good day!
His damage is training related
Congrats man. You look great.
"I love doing some partial laterals once I‚Äôve hit failure, so that sounds fun. Definitely gonna give that a go on my next push day, thanks man."
For now. Missing my game on Saturday so may just finish up the season so I can stay sharp for college soccer
"Okay so your issue is more around your sacrum rather the lumbar spine? Regardless, I‚Äôd drop the weight and really focus on your form. You could also try to shift to trap bar deadlifts for awhile, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing lately to decrease the stress on my lower back. The trap bar allows me to lift heavy without sacrificing form or worry about throwing my back out. I‚Äôm trying to build more strength while maintaining good form before I go back to conventional."
"Agreed Wesley is a tank been following him since like 2013 , he definitely needs it improve on the posing but as far as his size and aesthetics he can definitely sweep competition with a solid stage routine"

You‚Äôre better off with the real thing my man.
Don't forget the tube socks to hide the calfs.

"That's true, i guess I'm just used to sports that are super strict on cheating, it's weird to see one where the same stuff that would be considered cheating is done by everyone. I'm still very new to all this as you can obviously tell lol"

"I had the same issue. Unfortunately it‚Äôs just a survival reflex due to a deficit.

You look fantastic!!!
Do whatever split you like that you can do consistently. There are no hard and fast rules and you‚Äôll find jacked and strong people who have used every split under the sun. It‚Äôs probably the least important factor out of everything.
Make sure you're well hydrated.
"woah, mirin those big boi dumbbells in the background"
Legs/shoulders sound stupid af
Damn. That's some real mental fortitude that I quite frankly do not want to have.

"I feel like there was no in-between: you had Arnold, Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, etc, and then you had Michael Keaton playing Batman lol."
"Lookin' pretty good man, but it's tough to give an opinion without knowing what your ultimate goal is.  In general, you look like you're in pretty good shape.  I love the fact that you actually work your legs too (so many people neglect those in the beginning).  If I had to make any suggestions, I would say shoulders, specifically the medial delts, cuz the anteriors look a bit oversized compared to the rest.  Maybe a bit of forearms too."
The problem is you're pulling only with your back and not using your legs at all
A natural banana split is pretty good
Well you're doing better than I am bc I don't even have friends.

"No /s, go buy some tren."
"Lol ya im addicted to fitness subs. I saw good results on 3 exercises for each and 3 sets for each exercise. I often did last set with dropsets and I superset tris/bis sometimes. Make sure you hit all the tricep heads, focus on the contraction, and do reverse curls with an ezcurl bar on one of your days if you arent already"
That's unfortunate. First 5 seasons were bomb though
Told u...1st dick head replied.

Why not post some pictures so we can at least see what you're working with? Numbers are all well and good but y'know"
War with us
Alright whoever said Olivia Rodrigo makes pr songs was not exactly correct. If the music isn‚Äôt heavy enough to cave my skull in I can‚Äôt lift to it.
Probably a good background show yeah?
Activity level plays a huge role too. A lot of small athletes have ridiculous maintenance levels. Endurance athletes regularly have to eat 5-10k per day and you can always cut training volume to downsize if you decide your size is impacting quality of life too much
Yeah but like you had so many more natty gains to make
the female fitness social media/influencer space is even more toxic and filled with bullshit than the male one
"Honestly, i‚Äôm learning with you. I knew what mogged meant already...I just put two and two together lmfao"
Idk where you're from but imagine less than a anytime fitness or puregym. Not many machines I'd use
I think a problem with finding those people is that a) they probably lose interest in maintaining or b) die from other natural causes because 70 is pretty old regardless of what you've put your body through.
"Yep, agree, they could give a estimate"
Grindr is a great place to find like minded males that would be willing to be your partner. You do have to worry about the cardio bunnies and fatties (power lifters) trying to waste your time though.
My bad!! I am new in this!!

"I feel you man 100%. Best advice I can give is find someone to talk to. I found that my depression got significantly better once I opened up about it to a couple people (gf, mom, two close friends).

Outstanding. How are you going to style you hair onstage? Just make sure the hair style doesn't optically throw off proportions.
They definitely take less time given the exercise count and/or sets are the same. He's got some pump days in some programs that the volume bumps up to account for the lighter weights.

That's really all that matters."
Thanks it's permanent this time.
"If that's true, then why do some professionals say it isn't helpful to lift until failure? I've seen several YouTube videos that say it's best to leave 1-2 reps in the tank. That sounds like the opposite of a drop set."
Okay but how many days are in a week?
How much of a difference fit body makes. Holy shit. I thought shes in her 20s

Bro I thought I was seeing Serge Nubret. Sick sick physique. Keep going!

No, there would be no point on PEDs if it was that way.

And if you're 40 (well any age really) and want to get into PEDs, just use testosterone. If you're going to ""risk"" your health and hormone production you may as well go with what works and which side effects are perfectly researched so that you're able to mitigate them if they arise. SARMs, at least for now, are stupid in almost any case."

"Yes, but with existing vaccines &amp; current available medicines we can prevent many deaths from the flu &amp; the common cold doesn't really cause too many deaths as this one virus did in one year (CoViD has killed 2.9 million, flu kills 500,000 on average. Both numbers are *worldwide*; that's almost 6x as many).

The real problem with the common cold is that they have many strains (over 100) so just like trying to find a key that opens 100+ locks, it's a very hard process. However, the common cold doesn't really leave long term effects like CoViD has in many people, including a cough &amp; susceptibility of complications from minor illnesses like the common cold.

Now I'm not saying you should or should not get the vaccine, I'm merely pointing out that what you said is not completely true. The CoViD vaccine is modified mRNA vaccine, has been around for ten years &amp; has been studied for that amount of time bc it is used as a blue print the flu vaccine, among others."
Congrats! Bad ass.
State that in this country we allow crimes to be judged fairly by the system. And i would also be 100% on board with laws preventing shit like this.

Potato talk:  
  
Dice em, boil em until they start to get soft, then drain. Put em in a bowl with olive oil and your spices of choice, toss vigorously. Pour onto a cookie sheet and bake for 25min at 425F.   
  
Boiling them first cooks the inside some, so you don‚Äôt need them in the oven as long, and it adds water. The result is instead of a dried out potato flake, you have a crispy outside and fluffy inside.   
  
If you‚Äôre making mashed potatoes, use Yukon Golds. Quarter them, boil them, drain, add to large bowl. Mash em up, add butter, whole milk, salt, pepper, and some grated cheese. They‚Äôre tastier this way, have more calories, and the cheese and milk adds some protein."

I'm currently faced with this and I'm not sure what to do. When I do a weight of 10 reps on the dumbell press I do it with proper form but I can't really feel the contraction unless I lower the weight. Does this even matter?"

Thanks !
I've definitely gained some size in my legs this bulk which is lovely. I haven't been force feeding but I'm already feeling ready for the spring time cut. Muscles feel bigger but so so does my stomach.
We‚Äôre out here doing rows like some dumbbells and this dude‚Äôs out there fucking chicks in the astral plane.

whats your diet and cycle look like on the cut?"

"Coat those bitches in hot sauce, tabasco, siracha, cholula all widely available and great.  Will make your food taste good and clear your sinuses."
At least he cares more than dad did so I'll take it
"I agree.  On an individual basis, I would never tell someone that a program is going to be too much for them.  But on a larger sample size, I'm going to look for a program that gets the best results while keeping the largest number of people healthy (or the best ratio of that I can find).  

NSuns has a bit of mythic status around reddit and I see it suggested to a lot of beginners and intermediates.  I don't have stats or anything, so maybe I'm wrong, but it sure *seems* like a lot of the people who try it get hurt.  The risk/benefit ratio seems pretty off to me.  If an individual looks at it and wants the challenge, go for it.  But I wouldn't recommend it to someone that doesn't know their own body very well."
Alright well I appreciate what feed back you‚Äôve given
No worries! Thank you
wow ü§§üòà

Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Nah this is golden lmao
"its also good cuz youll know your current stage weight and then you can compare how much youve improved in a years time, letting you know if your doing something right or wrong. and i also think bbers in the uk are just a different breed man, yall are crazy out there. tons of hard working mfers. 

credit where credit is due my dude, your actually making progress which is kinda rare in these parts. keep grindin"
well nice tan hehe
"Yep! I‚Äôve been powerlifting something like 6 years now, started at 16, one caveat though is I switched over to using wraps right about the start of covid, take from that what you will. Stats at my bulk phase we‚Äôre peaked, current stats are just gym lifts unpeaked."

Joff pls go
"Thank you. 100%. And for real, it‚Äôs all genetic based. I have good genetics for putting on size, I just did it the correct way, and ate the correct way. I trained with weight for sports throughout highschool, but never bodybuilding specific nor was it serious. So I for the last two years have been training bodybuilding specific, and eating correctly, lifting, sleeping, supplements (over the counter), etc."
No such thing as natural bodybuilding it doesn‚Äôt exist
This is goals. What does your diet look like as far caloric intake and current weight?
Great win for him. But Amanda is extremely unprofessional in her commentating. Her comments on both Nick and Iain‚Äôs physique/placings is mind boggling. I hope she‚Äôs never asked to commentate again.

Lifting for you today bro mad physique !
"I know that if you want a gain 1lb a week you need a 500 kcal surplus per day, is that also the case if someone who was very big before but lost most of the muscles due to being sick/injured then starts to workout again or will that person be able to gain in the beginning more than 1lb per week on a 500kcal surplus?"
"Honestly bro, you‚Äôd be surprised how much progress you can make from little amounts. Always operate under the condition of ‚Äòonly increasing dosages when nothing else is working‚Äô."
Oh ok
"Problem IMO is that there's still too little knowledge about the potential side effects, and probably not too much willingness to find about them and even less making them known.

A couple of days ago I found that it also seems to have caused issues in people with thyroid problems, now some seem to need higher doses of drugs to get them to the same levels as before. Which, the effect isn't anything severe, but as with women having period alterations, why on earth are hormonal systems altered?

I'm still glad we got the vaccines, but all this mainstream thinking that they are completely safe, and anyone being remotely skeptical being cataloged as an anti vax drives me nuts, I think there's plenty of arguments for some people not to want them. Personally, more than 2 months later, I still don't feel at a 100%, that's no joke in a 27yo guy."
Yeah but that OG tiktok deserves to be clowned though
Yeah I realized with a deep squeeze my hip and shoulder would rotate into each other a little

I can‚Äôt dance and I can‚Äôt play the harmonica lmao
Did you squeeze the fuck out of the bar on squats? When I'm doing high bar I tense up my upper body a shit ton to make my shelf more stable and I get pumps like that sometimes.
For a small woman she‚Äôs fine there. Most of my smaller girls are around 40f

"Oh for sure! I just find women are more likely to have the quad jiggle and most (at least in my area) have underdeveloped quads in comparison, so seeing them evened out a bit more just looks fantastic."
So I was finally convinced to go to a chiropractor and boy did I hate it. My neck and back still feel weird and it‚Äôs been hours
Yeah... take a little pride in your people
I find it funny when people get so wound up about the opinions of people who make money from their bodies.
Most of them genuinely look like they barely survived the holocaust. Minimal muscle mass (I see most people with more at the 2 year mark) and absolutely no aesthetics. And quite a few of them are not even that lean
They were literally like a foot away from him initially... You clearly don't know the context. You probably just saw that little video and thought that was it. You wouldn't be pissed if you were doing squats and some cunt was breathing down your neck and practically laughing in your ears? Not to mention they were disrupting a shoot the gym owner was literally paying for
"nah, just kept up with water intake"
"Yes, and yes for your questions 

My doctor tells me not to worry about it because it‚Äôs common in people who lift regularly.

Don‚Äôt overreact man"

Baby powder is a lifesaver
I lost ten but gained back twenty lmao
"Like i said the issue is a high red blood cell count. So should people from Colorado with the high altitude (which causes higher red blood cell count) not be able to donate ? We all work in places that have silly rules and stupid little red tape issues. In my mind this was along those lines. They also have several checks and samples to ensure the donation is good and to spec. If it wasn‚Äôt good to use they wouldn‚Äôt use it. 

So I dropped a comment to have a conversation about it. I‚Äôm not in the habit of deceiving medical personnel for personal gain. And as I mentioned below I‚Äôll notify them at my next visit.

"Well I'm always happy to help with that! If you want me to keep burning up some of your work time just say the word (although I might need to sleep soon). 

Drive through alcohol?! When I heard about the drunk people not being allowed more drinks I thought Australia might not be that great, but that sounds like a strange heaven lol. I mean if you can walk or talk properly at the end of a night then it's not the end of the night, but whatever I can get past that bit. The grocery store nearest to me used to be 24 hour but it's a small collection of English towns and villages so they weren't getting enough business in the later hours to justify it :( although that made it surprisingly good for buying weed so you win some you lose some. If you ever want to feel like Australia doesn't have a drinking problem though, go to Ireland or Scotland... Those lads go *hard* on a night out lol, I think Trevor Noah did a bit on drinking with Scottish guys that is pretty accurate."
High top shoes make my shins look shorter and thus my calves look bigger. Its all strategic.
"He definitely wouldn't be close to the biggest .  He's like 5'2"" and 135lbs in his stage shots. He only is taller then his kids in his instagram, and the girl in the pic looks like she is taller and heavier then her dad in like a year."
Yeah the legs are holding him back and he needs to be sharper and then it's game over.
Good podcasts related to training/diet/gear?
Smaller legs than Phil Heath? Yeah you skip legs breh.
lean bulk up and then cut down is probably the best bet.

"That's sweet! I got into plants a year or so ago, they add so much atmosphere. Coming back to my apartment now feels like home. Plus it's SO cool to watch them grow you know? When I bought my peace lily the pot was as big as my two palms together. Now I can squat with it lol, 20kg easy. 

&gt;I'm starting to get really into plants, but only the ones that need minimal care. Not tryna have plants that die if I leave for a week or two.

&gt; Any plant people have any recs for ones that like the indoors and are very easy to care for?

My personal recommendation is a Yucca or a peace Lilly. Buy them small then watch them grow and grow and grow. You only water them once a week or so. A buddy of mine left his Yucca for a month while on vacation and it was pretty much fine when he came back.

I'm at work now, otherwise I would love to upload some pics of my own plants.

"It's on sci hub. Honestly I don't see how this tells us much. The study duration and sample size are tiny, it's one study, and it appears created to prove something, which it can't.

Also I'm pretty sure estrogen is not orally bioavailable, so if there are hormonal changes going on within hours, it's probably the nutrient content rather than some tiny trace amount of hormones.

The milk used said 3.5% fat, btw. I guess that's whole?

Anyway, wouldn't read too far into this at all, if you're using it as a tool to decide whether or not to include milk in your diet, I wouldn't. Include it if you like it and it fits your meal plan, so long as it digests well and doesn't cause issues."

"Made a super dumb mistake last week... I grabbed the bar for my max weight bench press too wide (lined my left hand up with the outer most line on the bar instead of the inner) and now my right pec and anterior deltoid are a bit strained. They don‚Äôt actively hurt, but when I go through every day motions that involve their use I can feel slight discomfort. Anyone have any advice on how I should go about recovery so I can heal as fast as possible? I would hate to lose gains over such a stupid mistake lol."

"I really appreciate the feedback, thanks man. 

I agree, my lats and my back in general need to improve. I have a hard time engaging my lats correctly, but I plan on really focusing on developing them properly in the off season."

No but if you get feedback that it interferes with seeing your leg lines or something then most tanning companies offer tattoo cover.

"Pretty normal for some people to have high cholesterol. I wouldn't worry, jut adjust your diet for low-cholesterol foods, lots of fibre etc. Nothing a normal amount of cardio and diet with lots of fibre can't fix (or lipitor if hypercholesterolaemic). Honestly its not a huge worry."
‚ÄúYikes‚Äù says the loser redditor with no originality
Go suck him off lol
This guy is 20 ??? Damn 30 is gonna be rough on you
"Yes, go to barbells. I prefer the barbells over the other bars. No, the bar experience is stupid because you overpay for the same alcohol you could buy at the store and you end up in a dangerous place with stupid people who may want to fight you for having a muscle that's bigger than their head."

Looks good man. :)
"HGH doesn't do anything really. It's like spending $500/month on better engine coolant for your car. Are you a formula one driver? No. So will you notice any difference at all? Not really.

And the problem is you don't own an F1 car, you own a ford focus. So is it really wise to spend so much on coolant when you could be spending it on a better car.

It's the same with primo and all the other meme compounds. Obviously primo actually does stuff more noticeable stuff than HGH does because it is a steroid but ultimately you're spending a lot on something very niche.

If you want to spend all your money buy a bunch of MENT and go wild. That will actually blow you up."
"This is the dumbest comment I‚Äôve ever read on this sub.

Just stop."
Agree with calves and also suggest lats
"Oh that‚Äôs a stair stepper? Shit, I always used it as an assisted dip cardio machine. No wonder my friends gave me weird looks when I described my favorite cardio machine."
"Cardio and being active will certainly reduce cellulite. Anyone who disagrees can happily keep their cellulites and not do cardio. I don‚Äôt care. Also people get this dumb idea that you only need to lift weights and eat right. Like cardio can only harm your joints and that‚Äôs it. Well if you‚Äôre into science at all, research the necessity of cardio."
No this is Patrick
"Knees and elbow sleeves are a Godsend, I literally used to have achy joints from pushing heavier weight (especially on a cut), but I used sleeves the last two to three workouts and my joints are feeling great, no soreness or aches~

"Got Pfizer, first one didn‚Äôt hurt at all, less than a regular flu shot. Haven‚Äôt gotten second but my brother said same about his first and felt kinda bad after the second so guess it just depends"
"My brother has crashed too hard before (cut too hard) and he really believes his metabolism took a hit. It's only anecdotal, so it's only a heads up. He's 38, so pretty experienced and knowledgable on the subject, but it's just his experience"
Just looks like a funky angle to me
"Take 3-5g of creatine if you want. It‚Äôs not magic so don‚Äôt expect crazy results. You‚Äôll probably gain 1.5kg of water weight and might improve strength a bit. 

Why do you want to take supplements exactly? To gain weight? Strength? Muscle?"
"Mine definitely aren't my strongest body part, but I think for me it's a better call to save my cns for my back/chest days since my torso needs the most improvement"
Words of wisdom
"Lol Yea i don't see any critical comments here glad you stayed this, i have more advice for him like legs need major major work like 12 months off and leg bulk. But yes i agree with you."

"Exactly right. Test was considered a dirty drug and the whole point of anabolic steroids was to increase anabolic effect while reducing the androgenic side effects. Bodybuilders experimented with test in the forties and fifties but experienced side effects. Dbol was a major advancement. This ‚Äútest as base‚Äù stuff didn‚Äôt come about until the 80‚Äôs or 90‚Äôs. Stacking also wasn‚Äôt a big thing in the 60‚Äôs/70‚Äôs. Dbol, deca, primo injections or tabs were the big ones - at least in the late 60‚Äôs, 70‚Äôs."
"Does that surprise you with all the meat intake, weight fluctuations, water intake fluctuation, sodium fluctuations, uhm... Drugs? I haven't heard of the dude before but I assume he lived an amazing and full live with all those achievements. Not a lot of 48 years olds can say that."
"Ronnie is literally the best bodybuilder ever and people are trying to say he couldn‚Äôt be natty here because they don‚Äôt look like this. Stop trying to compare yourself to Ronnie, it‚Äôs impossible. Even comparing other pros to Ronnie is useless."

"Some delicious cereal with whey shake is the GOAT postworkout for me. Too bad I'm unable to control my cereal portions.

And no, as long as you don't overeat it's good, plus quick digesting carbs post workout are supposed to be good."
"LOL, I‚Äôll answer you Bro ü§£.  Okay, in all seriousness, not bad.  I‚Äôm not sure where your starting point was to see how much you have progressed to get to this point, which makes it a bit difficult to truly assess, but as you are now, for someone who isn‚Äôt prepping for a show and are still working on bulking, you‚Äôre at a decent point, but again it‚Äôs hard to say without a reference point with which to compare this to,  unless this IS basically your starting point, but even if that were the case, you have some thickness/mass in your legs, so you haven‚Äôt been neglecting those which is good, you have calves, which some pros don‚Äôt even have, so that‚Äôs good, and even in your bulking phase you can still see some separation of the obliques, serratus, and even in your quads as well, so you‚Äôre definitely not ‚Äúfat‚Äù per se.  You‚Äôve got some thickness to your pecs already, bi‚Äôs are good, your lats and v-taper seem to be developing nicely although you could use a bit more width so maybe some focused lat days are in order, but other than that there‚Äôs honestly not really anything bad to say, unless you were like ‚Äú1 week out, whaddaya think?‚Äù then you‚Äôd be in trouble, but I personally wouldn‚Äôt be unhappy with this if it was either my starting point or if you‚Äôve made some progress to get to this point.  You‚Äôll also look a lot different once you cut.

The only thing I‚Äôll really say you should work on, lol, is your posing, lol.  Tippy toes looks a bit awkward and just doesn‚Äôt quite do the Front Double the justice it deserves. Cheers."
"All strength can be functional, some exercises will be more functional for some people depending on what they typically do. At my old job I had to lift a load of shit above my head, so OHP would've been the most ""functional"" lift to train, at my current job there's basically nothing physical but I'm on my feet and bend down a lot so core exercises are probably more ""functional"". Anyone who makes up lifts that offer less benefits, and increase injury risk for ""functionality"" is a fucken dumbass even by the dd's standards."
"Yeah, haven't seen anyone lift anything close to 140kg in BP and just 205 in deadlift, but guess it may be a bit anecdotal too"

"I've had terrible luck with college professors. It feels like every semester I get at least 1 who is an absolute nutcase or two literally can't do their job. These are the 3 that stand out the most

Asl teacher who would berate and insult the class. Would randomly change due dates then said we lied after we showed her pics of the board. Once wrote on a students paper *the deaf community and the black community have a lot in common*. What does this mean? Idc

A history professor who would talk about the orange man every 10 to 15 muinets. To this day I still don't understand why he was so obsessed with something he hated,but good lord. Trump said this and did that and do you know I absolutely hate him? On the very first day of class he walked in, didn't introduce himself didn't even say hi or talk about the course itself. He had a word document filled with quotes and just sat there and read them. 

I took an Asian humanities class 50% for filler and 50% just because. The first dude was a classic bitter old guy who talked way to much about his own personal life vs actual subject matter ,but at least he had some good insights. Then he just randomly dipped, and the next dude that showed up was something special. To this day I'm convinced he was a serial killer. 

For starters he would just carry around a container of ranch. No other food in it just ranch. That in itself raised some eyebrows along with his bizzare appearance but then he started talking. He pulled up some artwork and goes *this reminds me of my house deep in the woods*""
Uh sure I guess? 5 muinets go on. Maybe it's because I live alone and don't have friends. 

Boi what? 
He also once implied he was a virgin. He started reading love poems and then got up in his feels talking about the one relationship he's had and he's just going on and on.  And we're just like, I didn't fuckin ask"

"If this way worked better then don't you think the pros would all be doing it too? The biggest flaw I see is that your muscles grow for 48+ hours after you leave the gym. So if you go to the gym on Friday then eat at a deficit on saturday and sunday you're just wasting any nutrition/protein synthesis that your body should be getting. 

Bulking takes months for a few lbs of lean body mass, cutting takes months to drop excess fat, recomping takes tren (or newbie gains). People love to overanalyze and complicate things when there's no need to."

"Alright, so. Show recap: 

[but first, some pictures n shit from peak week.](https://imgur.com/a/vjUUolC)

We actually came into this show pretty flat. We tried to make weight for classic class B, which is 190 lbs. the best I could muster was a rather dead 193.6 lbs. Didn‚Äôt make weight for classic, so I only had LHW to compete in. As weigh-ins were at 8am the day of the show, (stage time was 11:30 or so roughly) this made it a bit hard to fill me back out, as my best look while depleted and flat was sitting somewhere around 201-203 lbs like 2 days before the show. Nonetheless, coach had a game plan and I executed it backstage. I definitely came in a bit flat for this showing, but thankfully it was still enough to secure the class win! We know now that going into my next showing, we will not be trying for classic physique at all, but rather focusing on peaking me to my full potential and not even worrying about weight. As to what my next showing will be, I haven‚Äôt decided yet, but it won‚Äôt be until 2022. Big life moves and SOME growing are in the plans first. As I‚Äôm only 23, I have nothing but time so I‚Äôm in no rush to go for pro. I intend to be undeniable when I step on a National stage, so I‚Äôll be working my ass off in the meantime to make that a reality. 

I want to give a HUGE thank you to my coach, John Dorsey, for taking me to this win. He is the first and only coach that I‚Äôve ever worked with. Boy did I get lucky there lol. If it weren‚Äôt for coach, I‚Äôd not be the person I am today both as a bodybuilder and as a decent human being. Thank you for being the amazing coach and friend that you are. 

And finally, I wanna give a big thank you to my support system going into this show. My teammates, my family, my girlfriend, and my gym buddies all kept me focused and pushed me to be better every day. 

And that‚Äôs that! NQ secured, game plan set for the future, now we get to work. Thank you guys for letting me share this journey with y‚Äôall. It‚Äôs been a hell of a ride."

Guys I had so much fun in the snow this morning. I may have a sucky lift but it was so much fun to finally go out and do something. Apparently the trick to getting the snow to yourself is getting out there before first light. My SO and I got there so early the highway patrol wasn‚Äôt even monitoring for chains
"Awesome pics. Great size. Look thick. Solid. Tight. Keep us all posted on your continued progress with any new progress pics or vid clips. Show us what you got man. Wanna see how freakn' huge, solid, thick and tight you can get. Thanks for the motivation."

yeah live you life how you want but don‚Äôt bring dat ish to the sub lol
"Bulking during the summer is weird. Still have abs so it‚Äôs not terrible but it‚Äôs still feels weird. 
Now I‚Äôm lucky because I‚Äôm married and have a kid so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm trying to impress anyone but it still feels wrong for some reason but I‚Äôll never be huge if I cut simply just too look big on the beach"
hey ;)
"Ye no worries, soosh is p annoying in my opinion and regularly talks about pinning and taking sarms (he made one of his buddies- dont remember who pin him on camera once). James got dropped after he revealed his roid cycle after a few months or so but claims it was because of his political posts on his second instagram not being unnatural. Anthony is probably the only one I enjoy watching despite his content being bland at times by product of him being dedicated to competing. 

yes i know too much i have nothing else to watch during cardio and its hate fuel"
"Seriously, I think about him every time I lift for the last 12 months."
I really appreciate the insight. I‚Äôm sorry things with your family aren‚Äôt ideal. Hopefully they can see the hard work you‚Äôve put in. That pro card is coming in soon. Best of luck!
I like EOD
Yeah he blew it way way way outta proportion
"Problem is that fat is extremely energy dense and you can get much fuller with carbs or protein. Carbon is an app. You basically log everything you eat and it tells you if you need to eat more, less or what kinda macros you still need to hit. Apparently it's possible to get used to it, but I find it to be quite a bit of work, but if you want to really finely tweak your nutrition then that's the kinda tool you want. But for me personally it's too geeky."
appreciate it! yeah I was just playing around doing this pose because it is my favorite. goal is to eventually grow into classic in 2-3 years.
Ok but what if it wasn‚Äôt one day and was more like a cheat two-fiscal-quarters?
Thank you so much.

"Want some advice on how to approach my nutrition. I have at least 20-30lbs to lose. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 187-190 natty. I feel like I have some ok size. Just need to get significantly lean to bring out the shreds. 

My question is if you were in my shoes where would you start nutrition wise? Basically calories,macros,supplements, number of meals, etc"
Dude you go to my fucking gym! Good luck man!
Just give them the zyzz pose and you win
talking out of your ass
Idk who got first but looks like you should have taken the whole damn thing
"As far as I know, Pro Physique is great. I have met Paul several times. I know less about Elite Physique. 

For your first comp get someone you trust but definitely don‚Äôt feel the need to go with the biggest names or the most expensive. I‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs often the big ‚Äòteams‚Äô that leave first time competitors hanging because they can‚Äôt handle the volume of clients they carry and they‚Äôre paying attention to national level and pro clients first."
You look 30. Go easy on the roids

"God I have bad biceps. Flat peaks, high insertions. Terrible MMC to them, I feel my forearms and front delts taking on so much load. I bet my forearm size has increased more than my biceps since I started lifting. Previous workout was shoulders and tris and my biceps looked absolutely pitiful next to them. They used to be covered in a layer of fat which sorta helped but now that I'm getting leaner I've realized what I'm dealing with."
"There is no universe in which Kevin or Flex beat Phil, they're both also narrow, Phil has equally good muscle bellies, but Phil is more complete than either of them and brings better conditioning. Phil against Dorian or Jay is more debatable, but I'd still take 2011/2013 Phil over any version of them. Ronnie is the only person you listed that would clearly place ahead, or really even place ahead at all, of Phil. More complete than the others, muscle bellies almost as good as Phil's barring triceps, but much more massive and much wider up top."
Amazing
"Agree. Every time a pic gets posted of Nick there are always people shitting on him because of the veins in his legs. Nick has a crazy physique, haters will always find something to nag on I guess. Beating a dead horse at this point."

"If youre playing some random single player game who the hell cares about &gt;60 fps?  And many of the best looking games dont need that much juice.   Multiplayer games are all played with competitive settings (read: turned down) and thus largely cpu bound.  Warzone runs fine on my spare computers downclocked and undervolted 480 (paired with a 1700x lol).  Cyberpunk will struggle a bit but honestly its a pretty mediocre title and if you comprise on settings it will run fine.  Certainly better than any console.  Youre over blowing the need for GPU horsepower, big time."
Looks like a bigger Jeremy Sayers
Thanks bro. I never know how much I need this shit until I hear it. I believe in you!

"Holy shit I'm deaths scared now. I started working out 2 months ago, am a skinny fat guy, 6'2"" 168lbs.

Just did 4 sets,20 reps of weigthed squats (7.5kg dumbells), followed by 4 sets(15,15,25,25) of db front squats (same 7.5kg dbs). 

Laid down exhausted afterwards for 25 minutes but then when I tried to get up I couldn't. Like literally my legs wouldn't support my body up. I thought wow nice workout ig but now I'm scared. Still can't sit down and get up easily, 2 hrs later. Please advise"
No way! I watched this movie last night and honestly never clicked when I see King Kong chowing down on fistfulls of fish.
Yes it is you should be able to tell?
idk i just feel like the other competitors had a leg up on him...
Interesting. You can also use Greek yogurt. Also sub half a cup (60g) of pumpkin puree for oil/butter in the batter as well

"Well coming off the high of winning the basketball state championship 2 weeks ago I‚Äôm now on my way to our first track meet. I throw shotput and discus, right now I‚Äôm hitting high 130s in discus and mid 40s on shotput. For being class 2A I‚Äôm pushing the numbers that won the state meet in both throws. In 2019 the winning shotput and discus throws were 46.3 and 144.6 respectively. 


I‚Äôm still recovering from a few minor injuries I got from basketball in my ankles knee and hip, they are recovering quickly and it never hurts when I throw but it just tightens up when I‚Äôve thrown too long. 


We are pulling in now, I‚Äôm ready to go wreck shop!!! I‚Äôll report back after I break the school record"
Yeah I did my part and got vaccinated. I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre lecturing me. Go complain about people who won‚Äôt get vaccinated
"Oh okay you‚Äôre specifically talking about a barbell. I though you were asking more about the movements. Either way, they‚Äôre both great. Some people prefer one over the other. Dumbbell rows give me a great pump but I prefer barbell rows to load heavier and get a bit of extra low back work in from having to stabilize during the movement. I do both. 

I personally don‚Äôt do much barbell overhead pressing because I am naturally pretty strong at it and I get more shoulder hypertrophy from other movements. In general I‚Äôm not doing a ton of overhead work right now. But some people absolutely love doing overhead work and you‚Äôll find dumbbell overhead work especially to be a staple in bodybuilding. Same with any overhead machines and the like.

Every movement is a potential tool at your disposal and how you use them is up to you. Some will give you better results at different times. You may end up simply not liking one movement or another or maybe something hurts and there is an easy workaround. There is very little science to figuring out which movements are ‚Äúbest‚Äù."

"Honestly, probably just slightly above what I was eating prior too my break....as I was already at a deficit. So like 200 more calories maybe at most? 

For example, I was eating 6oz of meat for each meal, and I upped it to 8oz. This has made me extremely satiated and full... I have zero hunger all day long."

Looking great. What are your off prep calories like seeing you're at 1250 8 weeks out.
"No that‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve ever read on the internet about getting big arms lmao. My arms are 17‚Äù now but of course they‚Äôre not big enough, just wanted to see if other guys with similarly small builds are able to get their arms bigger, as I‚Äôve never seen anyone on Instagram that I can think of that has the same build as me and arms bigger than 17 ish‚Äù. I wonder where that bro science comes from cus I hear it a lot."
Yes yes I know. People thinking that you can gain so much fat in a night are really annoying.
"Love Hoffman but next to other Classic athletes he never looked as crazy as them.

Someone broke into my locker today at the gym and stole my credit cards. Walked to the target 0.2 miles away and spent $1100. I don't understand how they got in. The lock was completely intact. None of the sides of the locker were damaged. I cover my lock when I open it. It also definitely was in the gym because I used a card last night and hadn't left the apartment since then.

thank you xox
Compound lifts are better than nothing and you can still make good gains with compounds

Idk what that means
"I mean, genetics definitely plays a role. But there‚Äôs a spectrum. Think Dave palumbo at one end and Arnold at the other. Tbh I don‚Äôt think this guy has bad genetics, pretty normal mostly. But it kinda seems like he‚Äôs just running whatever he can get his hands on and that‚Äôs a recipe for disaster. Especially for being 22 years old. Damn I can‚Äôt imagine. I‚Äôm not here to judge anyone for their choices. I lifted seriously for 10 years before hopping on at the age of 28 and I think that‚Äôs the best decision I ever had. I probably was ready to hop on at 26 but I just didn‚Äôt. Taking tren at 22 when you probably didn‚Äôt even start lifting until 20 years old..sorry but that‚Äôs just not smart. He needs to go back to the basics for a few years. Just test and maybe anavar for a year. After that can throw in EQ or primo before building up to others like Deca/dbol that can be trickier to dial in. His AI dosage is just completely fucked though."

"Myfitness Pal is pretty decent for tracking macros and cals

"I agree with him having some trouble but I disagree with you saying his midsection is awful. Arash rahbar‚Äôs midsection is significantly worse and he was an Olympian 4 times. I know tons of ifbb classic dudes who look worse then Brandon. It‚Äôs only a matter of
time before he turns pro. I think Brandon‚Äôs issue is his arms. His triceps are good but his biceps are a glaring weakness. That being said his back and legs are killer and he deserved to win that show from what I‚Äôve seen so far. His BDB is killer. I think it‚Äôs very possible for him to have the same situation as chris regarding arms. The question is can he put the mass on and will it look good at the Olympian level. and in the right places"

Seconded. If I wasn‚Äôt poor those would be the only underwear that touched my body
"That's decent, personally I treat abs like any other muscle. I wouldn't do just bodyweight for my chest / back - so why not add weight for abs too? Weighted crunches on a cable machine are amazing.

I'd definitely recommend throwing in some treadmill work. Doesn't need to be insane, in fact it's far better if it's easy. I usually do 8% incline at 3mph for like 30 mins 3 times a week, gives me time to catch up on podcasts and it's become my favourite part of the workout some days.

You shouldn't be out of breath, just around 130bpm. The sweat should start pouring after 5-10 mins. That's the ideal fat burning zone"

"Hi, I can't thank you enough. Thanks to you, one of my biggest dreams came true today. I'm somewhat at a loss for words right now. Thank you for this."
10-12 is easy as fuck and much more aesthetic. definitely don't look as good in a shirt if natty tho unless you're near peak natty
You've conquered hell mate.
"Sure, so that means load up 10+ plates on the leg press for quarter reps? While also using your hands on your knees to cheat?

What's the excuse for the quarter rep military press?

Please feel free post the videos so everyone here can see them and judge for themselves.

Also, FYI I wouldn't have even brought it up if you weren't trying to tell other people they need to lower the weight and work on form. Heed your own warning."

"Holy shit, those quads are menacing"
"It's one of many factors in attraction. But saying it ""doesn't matter"" overall is just wrong.

Like take someone with zero muscle, and add 15 lbs of muscle on them (same BF%, same everything else as a person). I guarantee you they'll be seen as more attractive than their zero muscle version on average. 

It's just common sense."
"Couldn't agree more. And I'm a fan of Walker. I don't find him particularly aesthetic, but I love watching him train"

Guy has a sad life and nothing to do with his time so he keeps getting banned and making new dog themed accounts.
"So? Is that such a bad thing? Who else is asking the hard questions? Maybe I have a weird way of going about it but I do give a shit about helping people if they‚Äôll help themselves. So if I ask like I did in yesterday‚Äôs DD what people‚Äôs excuses are, maybe it‚Äôll force some perspective into people to think about their habits. If that helps one person change and reach a goal, isn‚Äôt that worth it?

One comment response I got was that a lot of people here have ‚Äúparalysis by analysis.‚Äù There is a ton of overthinking going on regarding programming, diet, meal timing, getting 8.562 hours of sleep versus 8.713 hours of sleep, etc when all people really need to do is be consistent with their diet, train to failure for stimulation, not exhaustion, drink water, and sleep. 99% of them do not need to worry about so much because they aren‚Äôt competing at a high level. Most of them want to either bulk without getting too fat or cut to 10% and have some abs and veins show. There‚Äôs a small group of people here who do need to worry about the nuances because we get on stage.

Say what you want but not everyone here has an outlet in their personal lives to talk about some of this to people who understand it and don‚Äôt just smile and nod or have someone to ask them the right kind of questions.

Next time you want to say something, tag me in it directly."
Well then you are never coming out of restaurant depot. Meats and fish are high quality and cheap af.
Thank you!
Yh sure man
"They‚Äôre great for the purpose they serve. They have seaweed in them and are packed in water - they smell fishy when you open the package, but once drained they adopt the flavour of whatever you cook them with.

You can head over r/fitness wiki and look at the programs available there, you should be able to find one that fits your needs. It sounds like you are doing way more than what your body is able to recover from."
Goal physique to be honest.
Nice physique. Solid. Thick. Tight. Keep us updated so we can see how much more thick solid and tight you can get
I've missed you bud
Autism and magic number powers that come with it
That‚Äôs interesting because I‚Äôm closing in on ten percent and all my body wants to do is sleep. It wants 9 hours a night minimum and tries its hardest to get a nap in the middle of the day. I also have to try not to fall asleep in the gym.

"i dont think one is better than the other, only know what i preference. if someone can handle a steep deficit without going crazy or cheating on the diet a bunch from the hunger, id say that would be better. alternatively if they cant stand starving, a slighter deficit with 0 cheating would be better. the better choice is the one that youll stick to more than the other."
"I hurt my shoulder a while ago and am still working my way back up, super slowly with microplates, to my old strength levels.  My old max was 250 x 10.  Today I hit 226 x 12, 10, 7.  

I still have a long ways to go, but it's nice to be using 225 as my working sets again.  I don't feel entirely broken anymore."
"Oh ok I get what you‚Äôre saying now. It does give people a ‚Äúfalse sense‚Äù, but I feel only when it shows unrealistic progress in short periods. Unless of course you‚Äôre saying all these bodybuilders are juicing, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised, just a little disappointed."

okay. thank you
"Anyone find it odd that r/fitness seems to think linear progression gains *run out* in like your first year of training? 

Some poor noobie will comment saying something stalled, of which there are so many variables at play, and immediately it's because they're not doing 5/3/1.

I feel like they really stress numbers and percentages above just training hard and consistently, feel bad for beginners over there."

oh I know that :)

How many calories are you bulking on, out of curiosity? You are 6'6"", man, the moment you put on some muscle you'll have to eat a shitton just for maintenance"
Youre like 30% bodyfat my bro. Youre looking at around 180-190 to be lean enough for another bulk

"I guarantee you if you ask anyone in any gym at any time if they work hard, they're not going to say that they come in and half-ass it. Does it mean they're actually working as hard as they could? Who the hell knows? But saying that you push very hard is meaningless to me.

It actually takes a good bit of practice to figure out what your limits actually are versus what you think that they are."
Thanks for the light roast . Im almost at 16 now lol
To be fair he didn't specify what competition he'll be competing in
Let me know how it goes. Good luck bro
Good. I recommend getting your money back as soon as possible.
Honestly I just can't afford a boxing gym/coach &amp; also I'm old now.
A decent person wouldn‚Äôt give a shit about that just like they wouldn‚Äôt give a shit about height though too.

It was super close and in person they were almost identical. They did the final posing three times as Samson and Nathan were basically clones by the end.
"You answered it yourself bro, take an easy week and recover properly before you have a serious injury."
Yes lol
Cheers bro. Thanks for filling it out.
There's no hgh in any otc or online supplement youre buying.

I dump all of the lettuce out and then fill the bowl with Reese's

Did you rotate your hand or keep it straight? And did you lean back a little?
I obviously have no idea what I can achieve natty.

"&gt; also do you guys like fouad's podcast?

Love the parts where they just shoot the shit, hate the parts where Fouad tries to explain anything, because a) he doesn't grasp the simple concept that just because something works doesn't mean there isn't a better way to do it and b) he keeps trying to connect things that just don't have a connection. He's on that ""low"" protein train now, and while I think it's great for him with his kidney issues, the amount of stuff that is now caused by high protein diets in his opinion is just... impressively high

"honestly I wouldn't bring it up at all unless she asks

  Be supportive and ask about her, but try not to make anything about you and your feelings regarding her.

  As fucked as it kind of is/sounds you're far more likely to attract her back if it seems like you're fine without her.  Doesn't mean you need to lie and be dishonest or anything, but don't go baring your soul about how much you've missed her and want her in your life etc."
"Growing up we were always naked in the locker room. I'm not sure what happened that made every guy so sensitive about it these days. Like bro.... just get changed, you don't need to hog the stall or create a barricade so nobody sees your dingle"
"Will you be fine? Sure. Will you be happy? Not unless you enjoy wondering if each and every fart you blow will be another dollop of soft shit in your pants. Some people like fecal play, maybe you like that. 

 If you can afford to blow cash on protein powder as your sole form of protein intake, I find it hard to believe you can't possibly afford alternative whole foods to meet your needs. Seems a lot more expensive to me, regardless of your demographic. Maybe there's a reason your strapped and can't afford other foods? Just speculating.

Report back 6 months after initiating your potentially powder-protein-only regimen and make sure you apologize to everyone you were an ass hat to after you blow your rectum outta your fucking ears."
Just curious what workout splits you are all running?
Just creatine baby if you count that
"Lol, yup. That‚Äôs the one"
"I get no mental benefits or joy out of going to the gym without really pushing myself, wouldn‚Äôt work for me. 

And who do you trust? Dorian Yates, Mike Mentzer, Dante T (who all advocate constant progression) or someone who‚Äôs never really had any great results. 

Btw I‚Äôm not saying either camp is wrong, I don‚Äôt know which method is most effective. But Claiming people who go to failure are morons is pretty rich though. Dorian says hi."

"Pick what you care about more and train for it. Do you care about increasing your 1rm and only want to look kinda good? Strength train. Do you care about looking good and are okay with only adding 5lbs to your lifts every few weeks, then bodybuild. Power building is a waste of time unless you are so seriously invested in both powerlifting and bodybuilding to the point where you have to do both. In most cases, you usually only care more about one thing than the other. And that doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt get strong while bodybuilding or you won‚Äôt get big from powerlifting, it‚Äôs just about maximizing your potential for your goal and not wasting time in the gym."
Oh shit never knew that video existed lmao

"Thank you. I didn't want to push too hard again, over reach, and then deal with the injuries during my cut like I did before. I appreciate the reassurance. Is the deload still beneficial if I don't need it for recovery sake, but because I'm following my program?"

"Funny enough I was thinking about that book earlier. Haven‚Äôt read it in probably a decade but McCarthy‚Äôs prose is just *so damn good* that whenever I‚Äôm working on my own writing I internally gush a little bit just thinking about it.

Yeah you‚Äôre right. I just meant that there are a lot of guys that have had bigger biceps than Arnold over the years just due to how much bigger guys have gotten. Arnold‚Äôs are still one of the best though

Before covid I bulked and cut 35 lbs in 9 weeks which got me super lean - this time my body is slower on average so I thought 1 year of inactivity &amp; maybe an issue with my arms. I just thought some of you might knew reasons behind extra stubborn water retention in such body parts.

Did you read my comment dude? Lol
Dillet certainly stood out from the crowd that's for sure lol
Yeah i've been lifting for a bit. i'm on the slow journey to 180 lbs
"Yeah this. I went into a show thinking I'd bulk and cut for the next show 7 months later... nowhere near big enough. Take 2yrs off and bulk so that you're barely coming in stage weight limit, no point in putting on 2-3lbs per year when you can knock it all out in one go."
"Bonus:

Want to know how Big Ramy won the Mr O after coming in like 3rd at the Arnold last year?

[https://youtu.be/HctPTugeK9Q?t=141](https://youtu.be/HctPTugeK9Q?t=141)

He's first into the pose, holds it a long time, breathing in check. Muscle did not fade.

This is how Ramy won. Watch the link, i set it at the time so you can easily compare with Phil and the other top 5."
Wow. Yeah no. Maybe when shitloading lol
Maybe the chick doing hip abductions in the corner had something to do with it
"It doesn't matter, what does matter tho is the type of food and how long it takes you to digest it, better to get all your carbs and protein around pre and post workout, but not right before you workout unless its fast digesting like a protein shake or smoothie otherwise might make you feel sluggish but 1 hour before it's good time load up on some carbs and protein to fuel you through your workout"
"No, it's not. And not being satisfied with what you see in the mirror can also be a motivator not just a dysmorphia catalyst"
"Arms and shoulders perfect, chest needs some improvement after the show is done."
It‚Äôs a freak show that we‚Äôre all here for bro. I think Ramy‚Äôs physique is ugly as hell but his muscularity is hilariously undeniable.

Rest in peace John.
I was at a 5-year-old birthday party this weekend and you could see the natural athletic differences between 5-year-old boys. Made me realise just how much you're born with it or not.
Or your shits will sound like two-stroke engine being waterboarded with the solidity of cottage cheese.
Increase calorie intake by 3x
"Yeah, 180cm to be exact"
No problem!
Nah I was an obese fuck at 15. Started losing weight at 16 and by Sophomore year of College I was 179 and skinnyfat (6'1). Then I started lifting and that's all she wrote.
"Anyone got EAAs they like? Yes, I know EAA/BCAAs are mostly bs, but plateauing this cut so imma throw in some fasted cardio in the morning and don‚Äôt mind paying 30 bucks even if it‚Äôs just placebo. Plus Meadows is pretty big proponent of them."
"Awesome pics. Great size. Look thick. Solid. Tight. Keep us all posted on your continued progress with any new progress pics or vid clips. Show us what you got man. Wanna see how freakn' huge, solid, thick and tight you can get. Thanks for the motivation."
Ah yes so pretty much what I assumed. Thanks mate
"Stop flexing, you're going to set the lunk alarms off!"
"Have you ever read any articles about dead hanging from a bar? At least 3 times a day for 30 seconds or more, it has almost completely fixed my shoulder pain similar to what you describe.

I've been taking it for years and I'm scared to stop lol.
No you're pretty bb
"It's from a torn pec injury when I was younger. I will say this is my very first round of posing 7am checking in with my coach, after a few rounds it fixes itself especially after I start to connect with my muscles better."
"I can always count on you to give me a good answer and you'll never sugar coat anything lol 

But for real though age must be it, it's literally the only thing that's different about me and my routines. I guess I always assumed younger guys get acne and I wouldn't have to worry about it."
"Maybe for the mental health gains? But it sounds pretty lax to me, I‚Äôd rather just try to build healthy habits. It‚Äôs not just black or white (binge eat and laze or track and workout with extreme OCD), OP sounds like they‚Äôre still trying to find their middle ground."
What in the fuck is going on with his nips
"Deadlifted 275lbs for 10 today. Definitely nothing crazy. Also it was trap bar. Once upon a time last year I hit 370lbs for 3 on conventional, but after dealing with some injuries I've decided to switch over to trap bar as I ultimately don't think I'll ever compete. Also completely reworked my form and now finally get the cues of the DL in terms of actually pressing your feet (I swear I never used to use leg drive in the DL). Feels a lot better and I'm pumped about trying to move towards 405 again."
Good job. Keep eating and lifting. You'll make it.
"I second the amazing stainless steel saute. A very good addition to the pan/pot line up.

I do the standard 8h a day, 5 days a week and OT When asked, same as everyone in my Dept. Yesterday this dipshit comes over to help clean and starts laying into me about how when my dog was sick (vomiting blood) he 'had' to make supplies for my Dept (we were fine) and that he's the only one who cleans a specific area when he really isn't. 

He tells me I'm not taking care of my shit etc and I'm in charge of my Dept. Yeah, I am. And it's fine without him. 

I signed up for OT today and it turns out were working together now and I've barely slept because all I can think about is knocking his fucking teeth down his throat. Fuck sakes.

"It‚Äôs crazy how much it swings too, even into your mid 20s. My first test was borderline low so I asked an endo what to make of it, they had my take another a week later and it was a smidge above average ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

There was that case of those buzzfeed guys who did a test and one of them got like 220 ng/dl which probably should have an endo look a little more closely at it, but I would guess that‚Äôs probably on the uncommon side even with the male average on a slight decline.

"No no. So most other cultures besides westerns sorry not most healthier have a x3 faster transit speed. 13 hrs mouth to anus. On avg more western countries have a 100hr transit time. You eat 5 times a day and dont have a bowel movement 5 times a day those other meals are sitting inside you. Say you go 3 times a day you got 2 extra meals sitting each day. 

Depending on how slow someone's bowels is. Upping nutrients that most are low in that speeds up intestinal contractions is my go to. Such as really upping potassium. 

Other approach is a light laxative as needed a good 10 days out so you can ease into it and really see whats all.inside you of excess weight. 

It's good to eat more foods that clear you out regularly too so you know where you really stand during your cut and off season. Most everyone I see after having em go more regularly are carrying always 10plus lbs easily. You know Elvis died with extra 30lbs of waste inside him lol."

Warm up with leg extensions.
"Is the bench/rack fucked up? If so can you put something underneath it to help level it out? Sometimes even a folded up piece of cardboard is all it takes.

Call it Hyperbolic Explosion Intraworkout and they're all over it if they promise 10lbs of muscle and 20% on your lifts, despite zero medical oversight, but if you call it a steroid, it's cheating."
NSAIDs mostly. Moving around helps some too.
That's seems pretty common in men. Low-key envy those who have even distribution tbh haha.
"Yep. Shorter hair is a pain in the ass; the shorter you have it, the more often you have to get it cut.

And if it really bothered you, just ask them politely to move for the next one. They'd probably be happy to get a selfie out if it and life goes on. It's a public gym, not an exclusive home gym."

"From the comparison photos it seems like Iain wasnt fully in the pose in his back lat spread, abs and thighs and back double bicep.

Honestly really looking forward to seeing them on stage next to eachother at some point, hopefully Iain wins Tampa or Texas and we get to see it.

"This is an important issue, and my comment will most likely be buried. I‚Äôm a therapist that has expertise in eating disorders and body image issues, especially in men. 

What is difficult about body/muscle dysmorphia in our (bodybuilders) case is that: a) it‚Äôs a sport/hobby/lifestyle that inherently relies on the body and it is composed (as opposed to having a hobby where one isn‚Äôt constantly looking their body); and b) if you are looking at competing - even if just for fun - then you are introducing the aspects of judgement and evaluation, and comparison to others. 

The best thing to do, is to remind yourself of your victories. Imagine a trophy case in your mind where you can place your achievements. Among them, include your strength gains; the positive comments from friends, family, lovers, etc.; your own observations. Think of those achievements, especially when you are feeling down about your body. 

Does it sound cheesy? Yes. Does it work though? Yes,
But slowly. Much like weightlifting and bodybuilding, changing those thoughts/feelings can take time, and you have to be consistent. 

The other aspect is reminding ourselves that even though our goals are important, they do not define us. When I work with people (especially athletes) that tie their very being with their sport, we spend a lot of time on balancing the importance of the goals with the worth of the person. It is very easy to tie your own sense of self worth to your body. But even if you don‚Äôt get the gains you were hoping for (whether real or perceived), you still have worth. 

The dysmorphia is linked to an idea that says ‚ÄúI do not count unless I look like ______.‚Äù And the goal keeps moving. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt matter unless I‚Äôm the biggest guy at the gym.‚Äù You do achieve that, and then it becomes ‚Äúthe I don‚Äôt matter unless I‚Äôm the biggest guy at ‚Äòthat other gym‚Äô‚Äù and so on. 

How do you counter that? By recognizing your victories, progress, and other worthwhile aspects (the trophy case). 

It takes time and can be managed. It has to be a priority though and when you are in it (or at least, when I am in it), it is hard to see anything else, BUT, it can be changed!"

"Honestly, learning how to train on a John Meadows program is the best way to do things imo. Run one of his lower volume programs, something like CD2, and then gamma bomb will allow you learn programming at different volume/intensity thresholds and see what you like the best. I used to be a high volume guy, but after running JM programming I find lower volume with all tops sets to failure and back off sets with intensifies on big body parts if I feel up to it is ideal for me in terms of volume load/recovery/personal enjoyment."

"Another advantage of the slow gain, being able to see where the fat is accumulating.

Take regular progress pictures for yourself so you can see the changes.

Ultimately the specific amount of gain back will be what you are comfortable with/want."

Jose Maria Mete Bueriberi is fucking GREAT looking is what happened. Although I think he looked better than 2nd.
GameStop went crazy today. I‚Äôm pretty new and bought a couple hundred shares of clean energy stocks. Made $1000 today. Joe Biden‚Äôs plans on expanding on the clean energy sector will shoot those stock prices up.

Some of the most beautiful girls I've met were chubby
"yes, eat like a bodybuilder and adjust your calories based off your goals. numbers are literally numbers, its like asking if a 225lb bench is good. in general? meh. for a 15 yo 140lb kid? its fucking incredible. for all i know, your food choices are junk, your literally inactive outside the gym, or your hypothryoid. if your eating clean and making progress, your numbers are fine. if your not, change things"
"You should just compete because you want to do it. If money is your motivator, this ain't it. If you aren't willing or able to foot a $10k+ a year bill for gear, JUST gear, not anything else, just to take a shot at being a competitive pro, this ain't it. Notice I said COMPETITIVE pro. Plenty of guys are out there who are good enough to turn pro but not good enough to be a competitive one."
The detail in his back is ridiculous.
"If you have to ask questions like this, you should just run a John Meadows program."

Thank you!
I wish.
What a brave and controversial opinion
Ok
Thanks I'll take your advice. Have you found much improvement since seeing the physio?
Can I get some suggestions for a good creatine that will actually mix? I‚Äôve been using MP Essentials but it doesn‚Äôt mix well. It‚Äôs like drinking sand so I‚Äôm wondering if my body is even absorbing it. Also what is y‚Äôall‚Äôs opinion on muscle milk? I‚Äôve always used it but I‚Äôve heard a lot of negative things about it. I know these are noob questions
"Looking great, man. What are you doing differently during this prep compared to previous?"
Not really. Stop making shit up.
"Went to the orthopedist today for my lower back. X rays were good and my spine is in good health, so the injury has nothing to do with it thank god. Doc says he believes I just strained it. Another interesting point he brought up is that I have reallly tight hamstrings for a 17 year old, and so tight hammies don‚Äôt do much good for an already hurt lower back. Was told that I can still lift, but he said to just not do any heavy powerlifting and to not do any exercises that will put stress on my lower back, which I already knew. So basically my leg days will now consist of a shit ton of leg extensions and curls. I start physical therapy tomorrow to hopefully better my hamstrings and my back. Thank god it‚Äôs not a disc!"
Dude you're stupid. There's drugs that completely get rid of water retention and bloat.
"&gt;stop being a retard in your 30s

"Yeah if you want. Lateral raises certainly aren't that important compared to a heavy compound movement like shoulder press. If it were me though, I'd keep working on them for shoulder health. Its not good to ignore issues and just hope they get better"
"alright yeah I respect your thoughts, thanks for your insights, I'm just looking for suggestions unlike the useless guy who tagged you lol.

nah.
The gears of war shorts make this whole picture a complete show-stopping 10/10
Seriously? You‚Äôve got a nice physique I‚Äôm surprised at how low volume that is
Yup. Will try to take it easier today. I sometimes just get that mentality of going at a 200% if I got the time and guess it's not always a good idea haha
"simple answer: Yes you should be bigger and leaner every time you cut

complex answer: scale weight does not matter **during** your bulk you can go from 170 to 185 in less than 2 weeks"
Better to break the news to her now rather than have that be the first topic that comes up when you finally see each other again. That'd be an uncomfortable homecoming for both of you.
I'm 21 and the later is my goal haha.
no.
Oh dang. I don‚Äôt follow him super closely. How tall is he?
Nicks ability to improve in a short amount of time is stunning. Really excited to watch his career unfold.

"&gt; I start to decrease weight/reps. I hate it and I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs mental since I start tracking at like 2500 cals and don‚Äôt lose weight

Dude, same thoughts those past days. It's always the same with too. I keep thinking ""don't nocebo yourself, don't nocebo yourself"" no matter how hard I try  to tell myself it's mostly a mental thing, I almost instantly lose reps, bar speed, etc. The beginning of every workout feels like I've already done a workout lol"
"Recommended earbuds/headphones for the gym?
I haven't had the luxury of playing music since I didn't have any earbuds or headphones. I'm getting tired of listening to the same edgy teenager songs that my gym plays. 
I have considered buying sony xm-4000 and buying ear protectors for sweat protection since I plan to use at home too. What do you all use?"
good point thanks

"Hey guys. I‚Äôm pretty experienced with losing weight but don‚Äôt know much about toning and weight lifting. I‚Äôm trying to get some muscle definition to show on my abs and I‚Äôm down to 17% body fat. I‚Äôm doing a lot of ab exercises and staying in a calorie deficit to get rid of my stomach fat. The internet says I‚Äôll probably have to get down to 10-14% body fat and I‚Äôm about 4 lbs away from being underweight. For anyone here who‚Äôs got abs, is it the norm to have to suck it up and get a little underweight before gaining?"
"I‚Äôm notorious for really bad resting bitch face outside of the gym, and in the gym I look even more pissed. I‚Äôm actually not though, because generally I‚Äôm a very nice person. I‚Äôve even met people in the gym who have told me at first ‚Äúyou always look mad so people are afraid to talk to you‚Äù"
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Which is why cutting results should also be faster. Get it over with to get back to bulking
"I've got a 3a XL and I really do like it, the battery life and camera and just general performance is really good. I tend to prefer phones without much bloatware, I like stock android that I can shape to however I want it without any apps I'll never use taking up space lol, and pixels are obviously one of the best for that. MKBHD on YouTube is great for phone reviews, definitely worth checking out his thoughts on whatever you're interested in."
Just ready to get my life affairs back in order so I can return to normalcy and focus on bodybuilding in my spare time. I'm finding it so difficult to diet and recovery properly when my future is filled with so much uncertainty.
Welcome to 99% of the questions that this guy asks on here
Lookin good bro
"Super jealous of the arms and V-taper! Good luck bro, you‚Äôre gonna slay it! Probably goes without saying but we (I at least) would love to see photos from the show."
Fuck you shoresy r/Letterkenny
Immodium is your friend
"Shit was funny as fuck. ""Just take test and mk-677"""
"Haven't read the DD in fuckin ages. I missed y'all. I was starting to wonder why *everything* felt so adversarial with all this politics bullshit going on, but I just hadn't spent any time lately in the BB community"
"Thank you, I too am thinking to take it easy on bench press for a while and go crazy on dumbbells"
"Moderna is for nerds with fake 5G, Phizer gang."
"I know dude, it‚Äôs just sad to see so many great athletes die just like that"
"Damn, you watched that many story posts of his."
Many people die of different things is what I said I believe speaking on the general public. I don't know any 90 year olds period but I didn't come here to argue just was stating a fact about things are different for everyone once again we all have a choice. Everyone isn't going to suffer sudden death from babbling a little bit. Pros or influences die because they are running insane amounts of gear plus insulin (which is the big reason these big boys just keel over and die unexpectedly). Have a good day though homie.
"At the risk of sounding like a coffee yuppie, find a local roastery and try whatever coffee they have on drip.  It‚Äôs gonna be tons better than what you can find preground at the stores or, no offense, what you‚Äôd try to make yourself.  My first foray into the (black) coffee world, I had some shitty office coffee and it turned me off from coffee for a while.  Then I found a local roaster years later and it changed things for me."
That's a shame. Don't follow him but he seemed like an intelligent guy when I saw videos of him. Like when he [interviewed definitely not Ronnie Coleman.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XadhUhNbNjo)
"If he trains his legs like he trained his upper body he would be sacrificing the amount of muscle he can build where he is judged.  Men‚Äôs Physique has divisions for competition.

15 extra pounds of thighs hidden under board shorts benefits him far less than 15 pounds upper body.

https://i.imgur.com/RJoD3nc.jpg - information about divisions."
"At least Breon kept his composure, true sportsman."
‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost 50lbs of muscle and look the same‚Äù
You must really like popping things.
Holy shit Walmart sells everything.
"&gt;How‚Äôs that waist line ?

Not horrible.  I still had some definition in some places which is a plus."
"Top 3 for sure, as for the win there just so many factors that can come in. I personally can't stand Bonacs physique, but on paper he is the favorite. I'd love to see Akim actually nail conditioning for a change and win. This whole lineup is strong its really a crapshoot until the show day."
"They are superior if you want to build strength in the Squat. As a powerlifter, i rarely use straightbar squats for hypertrophy anymore."
The replies make it pretty clear the tren hasn't all cleared his system yet.
Thanks for the reminder to measure my calves. I haven‚Äôt in years
"this is a tale as old as time my friend. Lots of past bodybuilders were very serious in a sport, got injured, and were instructed to start lifting to help the healing process. They then found their love with iron quite quick, and the sport they played became insignificant to them. Not saying this is you but just mentioning its quite common."
I support it
"I feel like a lot of guys start in their early 20‚Äôs, no? But yeah absolutely. Would be sure to maximize their efficacy by dialling all the variables and doing everything to keep my health/heart in good shape."
"Yeah bro, it'll fill out when the muscle hypertrophies"
Yeah they‚Äôre trolling. Most likely the liner from under the lid!
Nice thank you!
As likely as it is for Jayson Tatum to win the MVP this year
I think its feminine when I try and suck their dick and they won't fully take them off cause they're too self conscious of their inner glutes
Just know even if you‚Äôre beat to shit in bed you‚Äôll have energy once you get going in the gym
"Anyone else find that alcohol tastes worse on a cut? Kind of in the same way that carbs taste sweeter while your carbs are low, anyone else experience this? Even in the seltzer‚Äôs I was having the alcohol taste came through way more than normal and it was almost like taking shots"
But you‚Äôll have no way of knowing if you‚Äôre moving the same amount of weight? Machines and cables are never actually what they‚Äôre labeled. You can try to go by effort but your brain is likely to try to trick you when you‚Äôre starving. If you‚Äôre like 2-3 weeks out I get it. If you‚Äôre over a month out you have to focus on doing the same movements with the same weight at the same tempo for as long as possible to avoid losing muscle.
Look ready
Wood platform seems to be the only good solution
"i have a conspiracy theory.Few years ago I was reading this book about marketing and there was a research how men don‚Äôt think straight when they are horny/aroused and that makes them make bad decisions and spend more money on buying things that they don‚Äôt need.Nowadays everywhere you turn,there is something sexual,not only commercial but if you look at youtubes ‚Äúshorts‚Äù,instagram...its like a pornhub light.My point is that all of this is set up by big companies to make men order even more things online."
If your testosterone is low just pull back on the syringe more
Time to dedicate to calisthenics like if you‚Äôre in a fucking prison cell.
"He‚Äôs rich af. He can drop like 20k on thousands of new hair follicles. He can get a full head of hair whenever he wants...

Congrats bro! Amazing transformation!
Thanks appreciate it. Starting to increase cals and dirty up the diet a bit.
"Mental gains are best gains tbh. If you don't click or feel comfortable with the therapist, don't give up mane. Be open to trying a different one"
"shut up lol, just do 500mg. 

&gt; AND its not overwhelming for the first go

test isn't overwhelming FULL STOP. stop with all these random bs cycle plans and just do what works.

 8 weeks of test then 4-6 weeks of anavar? in what world does that make any sense at all? have you learned nothing?"
"If I squint my eyes a bit he looks like a roast turkey

Like a 25lb one"
yes definitely !
I agree Ronnie is the best so far among all bodybuilders... But I was asking about ‚Äúthe best of HIS time‚Äù not the best all time
Definitely crocs
Not usual. Make sure you don't have any underlying allergies to some ingredient in the pre and that it was something in the preworkout that caused it
"Yeah that must work quite well, plus pull-ups are something that seem to improve a lot with frequency.

If only doing 3 reps of some ab exercise was enough to grow them a little haha"
Solid trolling. 8.5/10
One involves a gun one involves people working out. Like come on. Innapropriate policing.
No dude literally all you do is post this guy in different subs
That‚Äôs extremely interesting. What‚Äôs the main focus of your research if you are able/willing to share?
Very inspiring! Keep up the good work!
I‚Äôm seeing Dustin Poirier lol
5‚Äô6 121 lbs and 29% BF. I‚Äôm scared to cut cuz I wanna keep growing (I‚Äôm 14) what should I do
Yeah good point - second photo reveals that lack of ‚Äútrappiness‚Äù
"I used to eat like a bodybuilder but yes lol this situation has kind of made me have to change everything. Kidneys are kind of calling the shots and they like when I fast and I had to eliminate most foods from my diet ... so I do a 20-4 intermittent fasting routine and eat the exact same 4-5 things every single day. Haven‚Äôt deviated or cheated once in months lol. I usually workout at 6-7PM and I either go fasted or break my fast with 45g protein from grilled chicken and 50g carbs from crackers. I eat those with Splenda pickles for a bit of salt to help with my pump. Post workout I eat oats and protein and I finish my day with nuts. Sometimes I also have a low carb protein bar at the end of the day - depending on how I‚Äôm looking/feeling. Then back into fasting land. This has helped allow me to live the lifestyle sort of and have my kidneys function decently. Things like red meats, eggs, dairy, etc. all caused worse protein spilling and higher calories/carbs caused worse spilling, too. So it‚Äôs boring and light and I‚Äôm hungry 24/7 LOL but if I want my cake and to eat it, too ... I am not complaining. Beats being on dialysis and swollen to shit from high spillage :)"
That‚Äôs.. not how it works. Your obliques help pull your waist in to help brace as well as twist. Guy would somehow need to make his hipbones narrower.
"Damn really? I think the chocolate one is decent.

The strawberry one is awesome if you're using milk, but it's easy to get bored of."
Bodybuilding is stupid.
Yes that should be manageable when you're lifting ridiculously light weight
"Yeah no that shit is unforgivable. I could write an essay that just a list of reasons it‚Äôs shitty to give unscolicited gym advice. Number one would be literally everybody knows it‚Äôs shitty, it‚Äôs a very common meme, so doing it is intentionally being a dickhead"
"Close enough is sort of like more grown up regular show. Castlevania is awesome, so is BoJack horseman. Big mouth is fucken hilarious. 

There's also breaking bad, the boys, grand tour and impractical Jokers which are all really good too."
Definitely too far out physically for a 12 week prep. Don‚Äôt ever do a 12 week again my friend. 16-20 minimum. You can do it in 12but it‚Äôs going to be hard and try to minimize stress as much as possible. Pre apologize to everyone for your possible future behavior is always my go to as well üòÑ
"Love/hate when normies give me compliments in the gym. Walked into the sauna the other day, some guy said ‚Äúhere comes the Incredible Hulk!‚Äù which was nice, he started asking me about training and stuff, then another guy walks in and overhears what I‚Äôm saying and that guy says ‚Äúyeah you look like an Abercrombie and Fitch model‚Äù like bruh I know I‚Äôm not that big but come on, he could have at least said gymshark or something but Abercrombie and Fitch is almost an insult"
"It's really easy to figure out yourself, just try it. Also this would be different for everyone depending on stomache size. 
I would suggest you work on self disipline instead of stuffing yourself with cucumbers everytime you are hungry."
"Look phenomenal bro , 270?? Lol. Must have looked like the hulk !"
I like Brooke as well
"This isn‚Äôt Jay‚Äôs craziest pose, but this version of Jay beats this version of Phil in every pose."
"This is true, but more so because you don't know how to pose. Youre making your back smaller, by bringing your elbows/shoulders so far back"
What kind of muscle pain?
"‚ÄúHow do you eat like that and not get fat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you on a diet? You‚Äôre not fat‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs for lunch today? 32lbs of pasta and chicken? LOL‚Äù"
"Yeah, the storm hit on August 29th I believe, and I only had 2 days off up till last week. I'm just trying to figure stuff out. It was not my dream job by any means, but the money was too good to pass up. Now I need to find something I enjoy, pays decent, and kinda fast to get some income going."
I‚Äôm a perpetual cutter cus I just cut hard for like 6 months and then break for 6 months or sometimes years. BUT I started up again in December and I‚Äôm feeling amazing this time. For 6 years I‚Äôve been trying to  be a bodybuilder. Now I‚Äôm making my best progress. Dropping pounds slow and steady and reeking in those newbie gainz. I wish I was always this consistent. And I can‚Äôt wait for my first bulk.
While on a Vegan diet? Bullshit.
"Up your AI, boy you‚Äôre bitchness is showing haha"
Just checked the scrabble dictionary. Stop playin man...
"you certainly don't understand anything about bodybuilding, you don't know how to train, I won't waste my time with you. But if you ever need help, just ask me, I help you build your dream body"
Honestly I have no idea. I can‚Äôt figure out how to... move like that. It‚Äôs like my upper body and lower body don‚Äôt move at the same time. I‚Äôm thinking I need some cues that no one has been able to give me yet.
Lower your calories then
"You won't, no balls'"
"Nice. Asking because im doing an oral only for the first time purely because of the convenience, but i feel like theres a lot of fear mongering about oral only. i have to squeeze out a cycle in a short amount of time so i went with dbol lol. Used it quite a bit before but with test tho"
No u
Exactly. Its your own damn fault at that point.
Managed to knock out 70*8 on my dumbbell bench today. Big boy weight incoming. Even though I haven't gained much actually weight I've gotten stronger and I definitely have gained some vascularity. The scale is finally starting to move on the right direction.
"I don‚Äôt think any of OP‚Äôs claims are true at all. Casey‚Äôs arms were just under 19.5. Certainly big, but Lee Haney‚Äôs were 20, Ferrigno‚Äôs were supposedly 22, Sergio‚Äôs were supposedly 22, etc. Is this even a photo of Casey Viator?"
Vasodilator increasing blood pressure? Counterintuitive and opposite of most vasodilators. Are you sure about that?
Ehh... when people say he looked crazy last year or worse this year I don't really see what they're saying. I still contend that his best look was the 2016 Arnold Europe. 2017 was good too. After that his back majorly regressed and his conditioning has been pretty stable. I don't see any meaningful difference between this year and last year.
Lol
Hell yes
The way his quads sweep off his hip is insane.
"i see too many people loading up super heavy on shoulder DB press and that‚Äôs nice, but here‚Äôs one thing I like to do that leaves my shoulders sore as fuck, i feel like it hits the whole head beside the rear delts. 

Basically do chest flyes but for shoulders on incline bench, let ur hands go hella way down and go wide as fuck. ur palms will be about parallel to ur shoulders. i don‚Äôt use anything over 50 on these."
No
Thanks bro!
"Well well well, my city's almost free of COVID and I can finally workout in peace."
I first heard it when my friend played it after a whole night of drugs and alcohol at EDC and I just felt in love with it. Im gonna check it out
"Looking thick, solid, tight."
I‚Äôll check it out! Thank you!
"$60 shipping to Europe unfortunately. But I'll try finding something similar locally. If I were to take a break to reset my tolerance, how long should it be?"
Where are you in the competitive season? X weeks out or is this an off-season update? You‚Äôve got a great classic shape man really well balanced physique.
"way too often i forget about my vegetables boiling on the stove, burn them, and ruin my pan. Like literally almost once a week. You'll be wrong if you think i ever forget about my spaghetti though"
"heel elevated squats can be killer for quads. the reason leg press works so well is because your taking the strain off your back so its one less factor, but its not necessary. heel elevated squats/front squats or just going fucking ham on leg ext will work. im talking maximum pain double drop set, partials, iso hold, and then a full stretch after for 2-3 sets."
"&gt; and you'll feel well at twice a week

Let's stop right there because this varies A LOT from person to person. It also is dose-dependent for a lot of people. 

I'd much rather do 600mg with daily pinning and no AI's or negative sides than do some twice a week pinning with crazy fluctuations throughout the week. 

Even on TRT/cruise doses of 150-200 I *might* do EOD, but definitely not once or twice a week.

And, again, what works for me won't work for someone else. But I would never say someone will feel well at twice a week pinning."
"Yes you can but machines suck. 

Most of them are not created with a natrual curve and have many other issues. I would recommend investing money in another gym. 

Barbell will always be superior for natruals. You want to build strenght and muscle while being athletic!"
"I don't think Cbum is unbeatable like many others do, and I do think Robert Timms has potential to dethrone Cbum, but not this year. I prefer Robert's upper body to Cbum's, but Cbum's lower body absolutely destroys his, particularly in the quads. And I also think Robert will need to come in more conditioned to have chance at dethroning Cbum, which he may be able to do since we've really only seen him at the Texas Pro and he may not have been going full throttle there if he figured it'd be an easy win. But assuming Robert isn't at his weight cap, I could see him beating Cbum after 2-3 years of bringing up his lower body."
That‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for thanks.
"Question for those folks that cut pretty lean.

I've gained about five lbs in a week from upping my carbs, presumably all water weight.

How much do you normally gain right after your cuts and you begin to replenish in the first week or two?"
"His tricep insertions are low, they make him seem huge compared to someone with high insertions"
"I like the golden era and 90s more than the current era and... you can like an old Chevy 350 engine and appreciate the power in a new 4 cylinder eco boost. That old Chevy v8 is still a good platform. 

They didn‚Äôt know any better n didn‚Äôt seem extremely fucked up from it either. I have heard plenty people report doing deca only and being ok. But people do test only and get fucked up. No steroids are really good for you, all seem to have a negative effect in some way.

Are you saying drug choice has no effect on the way your body looks? So if thy ran tren and insulin they‚Äôd look exactly the same? Same body fat? No, Deca dbol would certainly add to their look and fullness.  

You can have good form and joint pain, deca has been shown to eliminate joint pain. It‚Äôs really good for joints.

So low dose deca being a 19nor may not require pct as it‚Äôs basically topped up for the Olympia each year."
That's called TRT. And yeah your natural production gets shut down.
"Yes, so?"
wait is this true??? Did he actually work in the torture department before he began lifting?
"Outstandingly fun type, friend."
I do it because the lighting is better in the gym
Lmao bro where are you seeing another 28lbs that need to come off?
Hilarious.
Thats what you think! You have no idea how much prep comes with painting thousands of eggs for those little shits to go around and find.
"yes i deleted it. if someone takes that kind of time and effort i always reply. It's rude as hell otherwise. i cant fathom how you can  see that kind of reply and just say nothing. there's a difference between writeups and just help comments. i made a complete writeup for you for two instructional videos.

And no. It was much longer and you know it. i explained the important details in the instructions, and why they were important to you specifically. the fact that u try to play it off as if my comment was short makes it even worse. i guess those stard went to your head big man"
Great work man! What are your lifts? Bench squat deads..
"Yeah Molnar really does have [god tier arms](https://i.redd.it/oxehkh8xvxz31.jpg). The history of bodybuilding is littered with guys that never could win it all but had those freakish bodyparts which still made them stand out.  

I think in this case it's a bit of a contrast as arms are _really_ cbums only ""weak"" point."
Yea dude he lost 50+ lbs

"I ran a competition natural (do not recommend as a guy) so take this as you will.

You just gotta focus. Like u/iSkeezy said, *you* chose this &amp; *you* want to do it. Remind yourself why you're doing this &amp; what your goal is. Don't detract from it, chew some gum when you're hungry (unless your coach says not to, then it's time to chew some toothpicks), &amp; most importantly do it for you. Show yourself what you're capable of &amp; remember that you're a fucking champ for going through with it. It's all on you, &amp; you alone. Be easy on yourself (aka love yourself) &amp; show that love by achieving your goal.

Maybe I‚Äôm just not understanding the context. I feel like on one hand people preach CICO as the dictating thing of fat loss/gain and on the other people claiming that carbs or fats affect it."

"Your point about blurring the face validates my point about looks and aesthetics.  
No Arnold worship. Personally, I usually assign a higher value to physiques like Vince Gironda or Frank Zane which are closer to what is naturally attainable, whereas Arnold was already geared up like no tomorrow compared to the generation before him.  
At the same time I love the 90s bodybuilders like Markus Ruehl or Kevin Levrone.  
I just believe that Arnold was immensely smart at training his body in a way that it would look perfect on him, while nowadays bodybuilders focus more on absolute size and proportions to reach certain gold standards which may not be ideal for them.

You can't just say someone else is an Arnold worshipper because you are obviously a Cbum worshipper."

It's basically the same thing as an RTA but instead of the liquid being kept in a tank, it's in a squishy bottle that when you squeeze it just squirts juice straight onto the coil/cotton and then drains back into the bottle, it's probably the most flavourful option and basically impossible for it to leak. http://imgur.com/a/hHYEbNv probably don't care, but I'm quite happy with how this coil turned out so imma show it off lol."

"The rep and set range doesn't matter. You can do whatever rep/set scheme you want so long as you are sufficiently challenging your muscles (i.e. training to failure each set, using challenging weight).

As for diet, if you want to get bigger, eat in a surplus. If you want to get smaller, eat in a deficit. Whichever you choose, try to eat protein with every meal and don't forget your micronutrients (fruits/veggies).

Diet and training are both important, don't neglect either."

Said I have carte blanche to treat my nose as I did in the past short of boxing(good thing I don't box) Said to avoid any punches/hits to the nose for the next couple months anything traumatic 


I can do everything I could before with my nose (it's still numb and stuff so I'm gonna be ginger with it) but I'm so happy!

"Yeah man for sure. On a day where I dont eat much my waist gets down to 26 inches, and I've always had decent shoulder structure and proportions. Just gotta get to the grind and put on some size."

Yeah
"Dear young men and women of Massachusetts:

I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre looking for a ‚Äúcountry boy/girl‚Äù on tinder here. Southie isn‚Äôt even near the southern end of Boston, let alone south of the Mason-Dixon. The west starts around Fort Worth, not Fort Worcester.

Thank you for reading my esoteric complaint. As you were."
Love these books! I worked as a field tech and listened to the first 3 books a dozen times it feels like.
you might have gone in a deficit too quickly? i mean those are very little calories
"If you're struggling to stomach the food to get the calories in, try switching to more calorically dense foods. For example, a 10oz can of mixed nuts has about 1600 calories. 2 grilled cheese sandwiches is about 800 calories."
Traps are lookin insane !
"Did back and after my workout it felt like it was cramping but not cramping weird but doesn't hurt now.

Anyways the weights are moving fairly easy when rowing I'm getting stronger faster than I've expected."
"My leg days have improved immensely since I stopped trying to make squats work

Feel free to roast it

Leg press 5x10/RDL 5x10, swap which one I do each leg day

Standing calf raise 5x10

Leg extension 5x10

Ham Curl 5x10

Sitting calf raise 5x10

Used to do abs afterwards but moved them to a dedicated arms and abs day


If you're wondering why I dropped squats, it's because my hip flexors kept fucking up whenever I neared 100kg, no matter how much prehab and stretches I did. Now I stick to leg press, I can easily do more than twice that for 5x10, and I got back that wobbly post leg day feeling that I had when I first started hitting the gym."
Thank you. Autocorrect trying to make me seem like a better man than I really am
Nice progress man!
Defines the muscles better.
Holy shit üòÜ
Yes that's what I'm trying to get at. Then you're just into fitness which IS great
"*The mods have very kindly allowed me to share a link for my research study here. It is not specific to body building but is more general to health/fitness/working out (including body building).*

Researchers at Deakin University want to learn about how fitspiration fits into the lives of young adults in Australia, its benefits and potential downsides, and how it influences exercise, body image, and motivation.


Participation is open to **people aged 18-40 who live in Australia and have smartphones**. The study involves completing a short survey of around 25 minutes. One-hundred fitspiration users will also be invited to download an app that will help us to discover how fitspo fits into your day-to-day life. The app will prompt you to complete quick, 2-minute surveys about fitspo, exercise, and feelings about your body, 7 times a day for 10 days. 

**Participants who complete the daily surveys win a $10 Coles gift voucher, and also go into the draw to win 1 of 5 $50 vouchers.**


To complete the survey or for more information please follow this link: [https://researchsurveys.deakin.edu.au/jfe/form/SV\_3CVoFf18PLvHAsS](https://researchsurveys.deakin.edu.au/jfe/form/SV_3CVoFf18PLvHAsS)

Good lord if Adame gets screwed again I‚Äôm gonna be pissed. He is blowing everyone out in the side shots.
The chelated kind I think... one of the types will give you the shits. Lol. Bad.
"Well he was certainly aware of the risks etc. pp. But most fanboys or 'home bodybuilders' aren't aware of it.

"He read somewhere that his original back injury was from playing football in college, but I guess the 800 pound deadlifts didn't help."
"Keep it up man, you look great!"
Yes I‚Äôve added on 15 lbs of muscle but I still feel small.
Why would you put natural in the post if you‚Äôve used in the past? Not natty lol
Thanks bro!
"Hell yeah that's so good to hear! I'd been steadily progressing on bench, squats, and deadlifts from January to March but then the injury happened. Not all progress was lost though, and my body seems to really appreciate me beating it up twice a day. Back to 100% in no time baby!"
"Yes, I have seen her here. But so do many other ppl post here regularly. Why her?

Its clearly an ad. Maybe they should add IG name as well."
One thing they don't tell you about cutting is that it makes your shoulders pop way more due to the clear separation between the deltoids and the upper arm. These things are like the cheekbones of the arms.
Nice job on the re composition. You'll need 2-3 years of weight training to place at a comp. Mayne prove me wrong in a year!
"Agree to a T. I used to want to become an Olympian, it was my only goal at one point. Then I realized why I am I damaging my physique and well being so much for some nobody‚Äôs before me on a judging panel to tell me how good I am? I‚Äôm really going to risk my future health and well being so some old bald fuck can tell me how good I am? Fuck that, there‚Äôs more to life than bodybuilding. I have respect for the work ethic and dedication the best in the world have in this sport, but I pity them for their close mindedness and inability to realize that they are killing themselves for nothing more than another human being who hasn‚Äôt been in their shoes to tell them how good they are or judge their potential."
He had pectus he did a very good job of  masking it
"Only limited second hand information on the losing the boobs point. Unfortunately it is has a high chance and they won't come back to the pre cut level. But this is based on anecdotes from ladies to a female friend, so I'd be intrigued to hear from other people's experiences and opinions.

As for not completely losing your shit. Depends on your personal motivation, discipline, and approaches.

Some quick approach tips - cheat meals. They can curb cravings. This is the usual go to for a lot of people.

Some people plan in treats/Sweets other foods within their diet so the cravings don't get crazy."
One of the most honest bodybuilders ever. Spoke openly about everything. His videos on YT are no less than a PED certificate. RIP.
"Haha thanks bro, very excited to step on stage for the first time !"
"This is gonna sound so dumb but I watched Alan's video on meal prepping (I think he released it in the last week or so) and I was finally like k, I need to get over my fear of a propane grill exploding and got my pops to teach me how to grill chicken and I'm never going back to baked chicken. Can't do it, won't do it. This is the way.

A bit embarrassed it's taken me this long to try it myself but it just opened up so much in terms of cooking good shit."
"Idk, for me I think its the exertion on my muscles or maybe the circulation having better places to go. My gym gets kimda hot and I end up with a nubbin all workout and a few hours after too"
"Nah they just seem to have potential until they hop on stage . ‚Äú Proper ‚Äú bodybuilders are next level compared to these Insta bodybuilders  . 
On the tattoos : if I was serious about becoming a pro , I‚Äôd do whatever it took . That includes not getting huge tattoos. They ruin a physique when competing IMO . Looks good from a ‚Äú fashion ‚Äú perspective but not bodybuilding"

"My mother and brothers did, yeah. Skinny and/or scrawny."
"I eat full fat cheese. Yogurt I want to save as many calories I want because I throw in mix-ins. Chopped fruit, swirl of jam, chocolate of any kind chopped up, marshmallows, cereal. If you used bb.com from 08 to 11 you'd have heard of this and protein fluff. I usually get yogurt and slowly mix in anywhere from a scoop to a scoop and a half of my choice of whey and some dairy milk or nut milk if it's your thing. I then pick what I want. It's something I made about once a week and it's like eating a full meal without sitting down to a meal. It's very filling and I can knock a decent amount of macros and micros in if I've got a decent amount of ""good"" stuff in the day.

As for PB2 or PBFit... lol I have those but never thought of using them in yogurt. Wow, I feel like a moron."

"Ah, that sucks man. Check out John Jewett‚Äôs Animal Homegrown program. Jewett is a super smart dude, that is mostly bodyweight stuff and will definitely work better than messing around with light dumbbells.

Appreciate the advice!
"Totally agree, great quads and lats"
Where does it hurt?
Good read. Thank you
"No are just stupid
Same stats would mean same bf or else some obese person would also have same stats idiot
He is not over any natty scale lol how can you even say so
I think i recall you calling me a fake natty a little over a year ago aswellü§£"
Don't obsess over an arbitrary number assigned as body fat percentage. If you want to lose weight then do a diet + cardio + resistance training.
"If you don't have a needle in your ass or a pill in your mouth while you are being asked, then you're natural."
Rest and very low calories
OH and also [LOOK AT MY ADORABLE FUCKING DOG](https://i.imgur.com/eToFaQ0.jpg)
When I took it I had ridiculous pumps &amp; was never tired idk what this guy is on about.
"YES, you sir, have an upvote."
Pray for this guys dock
I tried but the sub doesn't allow option to join or post freely.
It looks like his entire right upper body is smaller than his left. I guess he just wanted to even things out?
"Yeah looks pretty comparable to last year, plus his waist is tighter this year. But its hard to compare without a full set of pics, and that livestream is just ass."
No. You still need an adequate amount of food to sustain daily function and preserve muscle. Driving calories down just to avoid cardio is a HORRIBLE idea. It's much easier for you to burn 300 calories doing cardio than it is to reduce food by 300 calories when food is already low.
"Yeah man in this field there are people claiming all sorts of magic . The whole internet is filled with it haha . I only filter out the things that seem helpful  to me.

Good point about giving ur self some slack . Progress will come naturally as our bodies adapt ."
One guy at my old gym described it pretty well I think: for calves you start counting reps only if it starts to burn.
"Had a 7 mile run on rest day, felt great!"
No problem!
"You have to be my favorite natty physique on the sub. I honestly think nothing is missing or overpowering anything else, good detail, nice and conditioned but not stringy. Also the quad cuts are so deep! And at 6‚Äô1 and 20 y/o, you have great potential"
True. Should call them everyday to shame them.
"Bummer about your show getting cancelled, but you got this. Great crimson posers btw, looks good."
"That‚Äôs an excellent idea mate, I‚Äôm currently working on This prototype and need more info to incorporate it, I will consider this idea, i highly appreciate the feedback mate"
"Dude I legitimately think EVERYTHING is best burnt. Veggies, popcorn, potatoes... yum ü§§"
I have that easy and my arms are definitely still small
Good bro! Currently reading a book my mom recommended named *A Man Called Ove* and I‚Äôm really enjoying it! Hbu?
"Back in the mid 2000s, I was always amazed by Jonnie Jackson's traps. They looked liked a smaller man with Johnnie's head was trying to escape his body."

Fuck yeah. Ice those sterilized balls.
For conventional I'd recommend Alan thralls guide to deadlifts on YouTube. It's like 6 steps.
"My unemployment quest of the week is figuring out how to play drums at my house without being an asshole to neighbors.  Short of massive construction projects, idk what I can realistically do üôÅ

I'm enjoying the point of my bulk where I seem to be making progress on all my lifts simultaneously.  It's gonna suck when I start cutting in a month, but being lean is gonna be cool üôÇ Maybe if we're extra lucky, society will reopen and I'll be able to get groped by drunk women."
Yeah I think it‚Äôs too little water + high sodium
"For the love of all that is swole-y, HOW do I get my biceps to match. I‚Äôm a weightlifter thats taken up bodybuilding, and for the life of me I cannot get a pump in my right bicep. My left is a solid inch bigger than my right and no matter what I do I can‚Äôt get the same sensation in the right as I do in the other side"
Wish he'd measure them already. Frank did and his were 17s. I'm guessing his are 16s.

"The problem with 5/3/1 and 3x3-5 is it's extremely low volume.

that's why I can't hop onto any routine because it's either boring, low volume stuff or a good program but without a rep scheme I desire"
"Consider it as recovery, don‚Äôt go too crazy with food, but your body will thank you for the rest!~"
"You shouldn‚Äôt have to ruin your whole life for it. Life is all about balance. 

When I was your age I no lifed the gym, I skipped family events, left Christmas early, news years early, didn‚Äôt have dinner with my immediate family for 12 months and more because I was dedicated to going 7 days a week at 7pm. 

Eventually you realise that you can still enjoy your hobby and your outside life, sometimes you just need to compromise. I found that people online such as these communities and YouTube channels help with the whole needing to relate thing. 

I‚Äôve also made many friends through the sport, and have a girlfriend that joins me in workout out etc. you can choose to build your circle around what you love.

At the end of the day hobbies are meant to be enjoyed, and if you‚Äôre stressing about it affecting your life, something needs to change."
Why win two pro cards?
Unless you're competing allow yourself some non strict meals. Life isn't all bodybuilding all the time
Ahhhh. Makes much more sense. Good luck! üòåüëç
Why do you need bars to improve yourself socially
Well I guess I‚Äôm no longer a lesbian
"Straight and speaking as someone that technically has that opportunity, no"
What a great chest.
"Yes sir, lol, until Feb 18th of this year. Just started my first cycle. So 40lb 100% natty. 5lb up on this cycle already."
"Yeah I'm finding GB odd in that respect too, where he says use the same weight as last week but 4x10 instead of 4x8 for example. Relies on me having written it down! Unless the spreadsheet comes with it when bought? The PDF is a faff to scroll down from the start before each session, although guess I could print it or something."
Glad to hear someone else holds water in their nips too lol
If you want big arms you work out your arms. If you want big abs you work out your abs.
"1. If gym says you have to, please do.

2. If you feel safer with it, do it. Don't listen to those that are upset they had to wear it for the past 1+ year; them not wanting to wear it anymore has nothing to do with you.

That being said, you're almost completely immune now that you are vaccinated &amp; catching CoViD is very unlikely (though nothing is 100%)."
Calling someone a dickhead and I don‚Äôt bat and eye. Calling the head of a penis a dickhead sounds weird as hell even tho that‚Äôs literally what it is üòÖ

This whole thread is a murder scene. I‚Äôm out.
"JM Blakely  
Dave Tate

Not BBs but strong as fuck and they know their shit."
"It's hard for people without a clear goal in mind to understand that mindset. 

Hell, I even remember being like that myself as a teenager. I couldn't for the life of me understand why one of my friends couldn't skip a day or two of training. It clicked for me one day when he told me straight up ""it's not that I can't skip it, I don't want to skip it"". 

He ended up being a pretty good soccer player, and I'd chalk that up largely to his determination.

Took me until I was 25 to get serious about training, and now I'm the one who has to explain to friends why I'm training new years day morning, haha.

If you have a dream, go fucking get it. Anyone who doesn't want to be a part of that has made their choice not to support you. 

My girlfriend probably doesn't get why I spend so much time in the gym, but she has her own hobbies that border on obsessions, so she gets my passion and supports me."
So this is how I would look like at 196Ibs 6‚Äô 3‚Äù
This makes me very angry.
A conservative anti-masker?  How original.
Uh... no
I agree. I'm going to focus on making sure everything is balanced before I move back to deadlifts.
"Oh cool, I didn't know you were an expert on 1960s Austrian military laws."
"Appreciate it, thank you!"
"GOOD FUCKING MORNING it's friday guys, kill your lifts and stay positive. Back, bi's and forearm day today for me - then girlfriends place after work. She wants me to stay all weekend and Sunday night, go straight to work from her house and use her gym. Sounds like she wants me to start staying over during the week too. ü•∫"
"&gt;is it okay to use abit of leg kick to ""force the rep in""?

Why not just use a band? That way you're still working the proper muscle without using momentum/swing/kip.

So go eat some buddy. Full on restriction can be detrimental unless you're prepping for the stage or something.
Oh I forgot to put in the original post (I‚Äôll go fix it) if you like really sweet stuff you can add 3-5 packets of sweetener. I used 5 but I like everything stupidly stupidly sweet

"Eh, I‚Äôd say it really comes down to trust vs. distrust."
I don‚Äôt even take creatine anymore. Guess I‚Äôm a non responder.
"Tried it for while. I think you'd have better results from:

Blast (exogenous testosterone for libido)

Atleast a Gallon of Water (seminal and precum volume)

Kegels (for load distance and orgasm intensity)

Edging and not jacking off for a week or two. (Helps with getting you primed)

A balanced diet with a lot of food (fruits, veggies, high amounts of dietary fat).

Watermelon has a boat load of Citrulline in it, as well as high water content, so you get the benefits of higher NO for erections and seminal volume.

Pineapple is supposed to help with taste, so throw some in with a slice of watermelon in a blender.

I think ZMA is the only thing that helped, as I was waking up with morning wood everyday while taking it, and even then I think grabbing a steak or two a week will help more."
Nice work keep it upüëç
You look phenomenal! Best of luck!
You can probably look to gain 5-10lbs in the first month. After that I would slow it down

I‚Äôve eaten 800 calories and have had 86g of protein so far"
You could end up compromising the growth of your johnson. Don't do it.
"No chance!  Barely in surplus I would imagine but the food I ate would be the sort to give loads of bloat. And also retain water. 
The comment did make me feel better. 21000 in excess imagine that!"
Ok I‚Äôve never seen a person rip there Pec doing machine press. I have seen people tear and snap shit up on bar bell pressing. If you really wanna go on about how bar bells r better I‚Äôm good. I grow fine from machines and db. And I feel them both better then barbell anyway which matters even more.
Sheesh thanks for the crazy compliment.

You can body build in a healthy way. Body building does not automatically mean steroids.
"Damn, the most I'll leave in reserve is 3, and even though I have a lot of experience it's pretty hard to judge when I've hit the right point. I can only imagine that a newbie doing ""4 reps in reserve"" means bailing on the exercise as soon as the reps start slowing down."

"I‚Äôve lost ~50lb this cut and felt very good for the most part. Last 2 weeks have been shit tho. As of today I have a week to go and energy levels are all time low. Cravings are pretty insane but still manageable. But when you think through your progress from the start then you should be okay for the most part. 

As for caffeine, I drink like 2-3 cups of coffee. Help with energy and keep me somewhat full."

Awesome work
Squats and walking. Easy.
I honestly had no clue it was that prevalent is all. Interesting
"Yes, completely agree, everyone‚Äôs different!"
"Haha! I was thinking the same. I think it has to do with the wrinkles under the eyes (which the lighting highlights), thinning eyebrows and receding hairline. Yes, he looks way above his age. When bodybuilders kept it simple with ""supplements"" back in the day, they looked way younger."
i like that denis wolf type of long torso tho
It‚Äôs decent. Don‚Äôt worry about it though
"Upper body looks great, I think your legs are good too but you chose the wrong angle and lighting for this pic which doesn't do justice to your lower body at al."

ok thx
"Hahahaha thanks FSPS, means a lot coming from you (not sarcasm I value your opinions on this board a lot) and yes I always freaking do that when I finish the set for some reason ha!"
Thanks!
Top 5? No chance but seeing him in that bottom 3 call out when he was inside out and the others were 6 weeks out sucked. I have spoken to him about it before I know it really hurt him to place last looking so good in his hometown at his favorite show

"Thank you for the advice, Stephen Hawking."
"No, MK will have a minimal impact if anything. It doesn't even prevent MPB in the first place it just is supposed to increase density overall. I would not even touch RAD140 if you are concerned about hair loss. What you're listing is also an absolute shit tier cycle and shows you have no understanding of gear or anaoblics. Running 3 different sarms without a fucking test base?? I bet you don't even bench 250. There is no such thing as a hair safe cycle but the closest you can get is to run low dose test with a 5-AR inhibitor (ideally Dutasteride). If you want even more protection you could add in a topical anti-androgen like [RU-58841.](https://RU-58841.So) So the most hair safe cycle would be something like 300-500 mg test + Dutasteride + RU58841. Even on a low cycle like this, guys have reported increased shedding, which shows there are no truly hair safe anabolics. And MPMD didn't maintain his hairline running heavy cycles. He lost a lot of ground and then had to blast Fin/RU/MK to get his hair back. He got lucky that he was able to recover so much density, he says this himself. Overall, it sounds like you have no clue on what the fuck you're doing so if you are concerned about your hair go improve your diet and don't touch gear."
Alright mate. Thanks for the help
"Read the books:

No More Mr Nice Guy by Robert Glover

Models my Mark Manson

It's quite easy to find girls who are passionate about lifting on instagram, your local gym, your local bar scene, a crossfit gym, tinder, bumble, etc. 

My fiance was always intimidated by weights and didnt know what to do, but [now she loves to lift](https://imgur.com/a/tEgj5Zh) while before she was a cardio bunny. Just gotta be more creative."
Fair point. Was just curious but long as I'm progressing on both it doesn't really matter.
"As a newbie, can you please explain the gyno to me so I can understand what you're looking at?"
"Only if I wake up badly, usually I know I have to get to the gym and so power through."
"Estrogen fluctuation is pretty significant too. E2 elevation lags behind test and fluctuations like that where you mess up AI or a pin by a day can cause acne to pop up. I pin once a week on my cruise and if I pin one day late I'll have a few white heads on my back. I can run like 800 test with no ai and be fine but if I miss one pin, acne. None whatsoever if I'm on time."
"No I meant more than 1900 , like that‚Äôs my ‚Äúmaintain‚Äù apparently, I eat 2500 easily"
Lookin like a Wood Carving of a Beast was probably his best asset.
Luscious locks and lifting blocks

Everyone is motivated by different things. I was born pretty poor so I‚Äôm motivated by fear of poverty. Some people are motivated to succeed.. I‚Äôm motivated by fear.
It‚Äôs not gay if you suck your own dick
That's what you said. Going to failure and doing less volume isn't better for growth than doing more volume with sufficient intensity but stopping shy of failure.
"Love his stuff!
A program from Joe and Ben Pollack sounds interesting. I'd love to see this program as well. 
I tried to buy Pollack's new powerbuilding program which is a mix of MountainDog and DoggCrapp programming, but you had to subscribe to his whole app. I wanted to purchase just the one program. If anyone has this program I would like to see it."
He likes garlic and power I suppose

Thanks bro! It‚Äôs great to finally see the progression come into light

Traps abs chest make you look sick
Lol looking at just the thumbnail I can see why 1980 would of had some of the other competitors smashing their trophys backstage.
"Great muscle proportions.  Short legs and a long torso is the body type to have for bodybuilding in my opinion.  Creates these big, long ab muscles and your legs end up looking more bulky in comparison which is great."
Looks like a good boy to me

Probably just looks like a normal one but with an extra rib tbh
Lol whatever you wanna call it. Lazy person if you will :)
"Great results mate! When you say built a back this off-season, do you specifically concentrate on different body parts on every off season? If so what do you differently when your trying to bring up a certain body part?"
"Honestly, solid. You'll make gains with this if you run it 2x a week. Just keep adjusting after a month or two if it doesn't feel right."
Respect
"Fuck off cunt, he's 5'6, but thats beside the point. Show some fucking respect"

"Just as a warning you really can't take much from side by sides like this. Difference in lighting and most importantly you can't guarentee they are both the same distance from the camera which makes one look bigger or smaller than the other.

"It's just a poll. It doesn't matter, I just was curious what percentage of people on here are natural/enhanced. Data is interesting to me, and we all know how impactful anabolics are in a bodybuilding regiment. No one is upset here."

Not to be confused with the mahomes cut that everyone‚Äôs been rocking for the past year or two

"Smart. I‚Äôm around 5‚Äô11 and sitting at around 176. I‚Äôm happy with where I‚Äôm at. Just upped the calories to around 2800 to simply avoid binging on the weekends and it‚Äôs helped a ton. I started at 18 at 265. 

Last year I dieted down to 165 (painfully LOL) just to mark it and say I lost 100lbs. It wasn‚Äôt mentally sustainable the way I did it. 

Just need to keep seeking balance and find a solid caloric intake to lean out slow and if I have a set back not lose my mind. 

Thank you!"
"Congrats! And ngl while I could totally go buy a sword, *winning* a sword for having a badass body is way cooler."

Best of luck dude! You got a good start!
"Pathetic no, but we should always be pushing to be better. Don‚Äôt discredit the work you‚Äôve put in already man!"
"What you are doing here is inspiring me. 

Lost a lot of motivation due to war, injury, and general depression because of the state of mankind. But just started exercising again.  

Glad to see someone having some gains."
Literally can't its now apart of me like an arm or a leg
Wow you are super fine
"You sound like a piece of shit who should just stick to a home gym.

I have 100 second rest between sets. Sorry I have friends to talk to inbetween them."
"What kinda dumbass question is this? He‚Äôs Mr Olympia, he‚Äôs not switching"
"Oh the gym is good.  

There's basically any piece of equipment you want, and usually 3 different types of any machine (e.g. leg extensions from 3 different companies) for whatever you most prefer, some plate loaded some stack.  Definitely a crazy amount of leg machine options e.g. hack squats, leg presses etc of many different kinds.  Dumbbells from 5-200 lbs, competition benches for the powerlifters and a few more types of benches over by the dumbbells, a few different types of squat racks (e.g. power cage, USAPL type stand, monolift), squat bars, power bars, deadlift bars, safety squat bars.  Crossfit/Oly area with bumper plates, some punching bags and such.  Strongman equipment is a little lacking.  It can also be hard to find matching plates and clips but that's a minor nitpick.

Most of the people are great, almost everyone will chat and be helpful, everyone actually knows what they are doing so you don't get too much gym idiocy, and there are some crazy big and strong men and women who can be pretty inspiring to be around.  I've made a lot of friends.  Everyone is a character, too, so it can be a good time just to people watch.  Some of the pros that train there can be a little stuck up, and of course there is the occasional annoyance of the filming.

Every third Saturday of the month is open house from 9AM-12 with breakfast served by Dallas Prep Kitchen, so if you want to check it out that's a good time to come.  Also, it's a lot cheaper than most other ""hardcore"" type gyms, like $60 a month I think, but for students (and I think Military and first responders) its $30.

Definitely better than a commercial gym.  Worth the price of membership."

Interesting I thought fiber would increase bloating? I remember reading an article from Layne where he says fiber intake should be restricted a few days before a bodybuilding competition because it makes you look bloated lol.

At the end of the day if you put all your ‚Äúbad‚Äù foods in that window you‚Äôre fine, I‚Äôm on 725g carbs and slam back maybe 200g cereal and fruit buns post workout and I still only hit like 90g sugar per day.

"Thanks! I think going overboard on the surplus has been a problem for me. I just need to watch my caloric intake more carefully and use trial and error until I find (or get as close as possible to) a sweet spot. Ideally, ""gaintaining"" is what I'm aiming to do."

"standard cheap B vitamin stack to pad the formula

shit amount of electrolytes, no point in having them in there at such low dosages

their ""strngth and indurance blast"" is 5 grams of creatine per two scoops with beta alanine to trick you into thinking it does something

Nice photosho-I mean picture. Hadi is crazy looking but im not going to pretend that this is an unedited picture.
I guarantee you that you'll likely never be on a level so high that you'll notice naproxen affecting your gains. People say that shit all the time about aleve and ibuprofen and post studies but the results are so miniscule and negligible.

"Wrong sub homie, this is for competitive bodybuilding. Maybe try r/formcheck"
"Well heavy is subjective?

Yeah definitely wasn't disciplined enough before.
Yeah I feel the same when I eat an entire large pizza
Fucking insane posing. Do try to hold the poses just a tiny bit longer. For some reason a lot of newbies tend to rush through poses.
Cry about it. You could also be one a pretty decent bench specialist your squat and deadlift probably won't be your best lifts as your hips are fairly narrow wich is a bonus aesthetically

"Your progress is admirable, to be honest. You've gone from scrawny guy who probably likes sausage to guy who'll probably knock up half the girls in his senior class. 

I sorta went through your profile and did some searching. Body dysmorphia is real, and I can certainly understand why you presume you're fat because you're a pretty good (?) athlete who's looking forward to possibly getting signed by the NCAA? If you feel like you're getting fat, you can cut back on your calories and lean gain. Be warned your progress in size and strength will also come down, but you will make progress. Anyone who's played a sport or sports most of their lives will have the same fear and self-doubt.

My suggestion to people like yourself, including me albeit when I was younger than you was: Lift as hard as you can and make everything count. 

There's a difference between eating and eating and lifting hard, trying to push yourself as much as you can before you break. Make the best of it.

And as always, losing fat is far easier than putting on muscle."

Half and half I guess lol. But yeah I‚Äôm a species where leg day is my favorite day

Really? I‚Äôm also cutting and I go 4 times a day
Haha all good bb Ik what you meant just playin
"Yeah, I feel that.  Technically I'm treating my attempt at *maintaining* as a bulk figuring that eating based off what I'm craving without tracking will probably put me in a surplus most days, so I'm just tracking my weight averages and seeing how my performance goes in the gym.  So far so good as I was able to actually hit a bench PR on Friday out of the blue that I wasn't expecting.  Must have been all the damn bread rolls I ate Thursday, haha."
"No it's not. I'm saying the people advocating for masks have no basis in science or even anecdotal data. The burden of proof is on mask advocates.

But, I can happily link you some studies showing they don't work."
"This is a great point. Yeah when you're working full time there's not a ton to differentiate the days, weeks, or even months that much.

I'm 30, and I've found that every since turning 26 I think about my own age constantly."
Put in a container and shake that bitch up
Most girls care about the bench number
"If your one day in, your glycogen and energy stores haven't even started to deplete yet. It was likely either psychological becuase you knew you were cutting, or it was just a bad day."

You ignore them because they wont have the will power to track their food

Thanks!
"Yea I trust my doctor. He‚Äôs a good one

I don‚Äôt like relying on drugs either, but I do want to function correctly!"

Definitely.
His front double looks... strange. On paper it should be great but it just isn't. I'd say his side shots are his strongest.
"honestly its nice to be 28bmi and look fit to normies. todays leg day so i was rocking some leggings and got a compliment from a chick that she wish she had an ass and thighs like mine. 

am 5'7 and 175lbs, deep into a bulk but ain't no fucks given I'm going bear mode and maintenance.

used to be a fat teen so really it has been a long ride, years of lifting and i dont ever see myself stopping this.

lifting has been the few constant in my life that makes me feel better amidst the shitty things and how crappy the world can be sometimes."

"Yea considering chris is that good, he‚Äôs technically the underdog"

"Fuck what a leg day. Pinned too much sdrol, lower back is unbelievably pumped, pretty sure I broke my finger reracking a 25 while still warming up. It split open and wouldn't stop bleeding for like 10 minutes. Its ok though because it helped me grind out a deadlift pr. Thank God tomorrow is an off day"

"Some of us are fat and out of shape thank you very much.

My birthday squats had me down on 1 knee for a bit."
I dunno exactly but I feel like it‚Äôs harder because of gravity based on the positioning of the body being angled. Also even weight distribution and greater rom.
"You should bulk until you hit like 180 with good nutritious foods. Then pull back. Unless you don‚Äôt care about being big. But if you don‚Äôt want any size then I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be here. In my opinion it‚Äôs just not gonna be worth it or a good use of time right now. Get strong, get some size in, eat on point, and then when you feel like you‚Äôve got some good stuff to reveal, shred up."
Nice to hear that ! Go get this you can do eberything if u want
Trim. Still smooth and no irritation. Plus if you go too close or cut yourself the armpit is a horrible place to get infection. No one wants an ingrown armpit hair.

"well, Cbum is my daddy... wait no"
Think positively. Gives you an excuse to skip leg day and hit arms instead.
Pretty sure it's 2 weeks. Gotta go completely cold turkey though. No diet soda or tea.
"Not currently as Im not in the most ideal situation to count calories. Soon ill be moving and will start counting my calories. I basically just eat 5-7 meals a day and try to make sure they‚Äôre each 20-40g of protein. I keep my carbs high, and not afraid of some junk food here and there. I weigh myself at the start of the day and at the end of the day, and I drink the same amount of water daily so I kinda use my weight as a gauge for how much I‚Äôve eaten as well as how I look in the mirror. Its not perfect but I‚Äôm definitely blessed that my genetics help me when I‚Äôve over estimated in calories. What sucks is when under estimating the calories my weight instantly tanks. Just last month went down to 147 when I had a week of lazy eating. Im back up to 153/154 now."
Jay is definitely awesome too. I had the privilege of meeting him also!
Yes sir! Alberta!
Oh you‚Äôre right my bad :))
"I agree, this is what his coach (which cost a pretty penny) had him doing, and since he has had some notable competitors, he followed it to a tee.

I thought it was overkill, but I don't know much.  I'm only now considering taking test at some point because I got into powerlifting late, aren't a particularly athletic person, and I'm almost 37.  I do OK, and I know the risks, but I can't imagine doing anything like that unless I was making a living with this shit."
"That is true, valid point. Can it be done? Yes. Effectively? Well..."
I feel like you know the answer but you just want someone to ask why you only eat 4 time per week
No he just likes it so you would stop spamming him

"Please know when to keep your ego at bay and know when a weight is too heavy.  Not a humble brag, just an observation.  

Gf's brother has been working out with us the past few weeks.  When I first started working out with them years ago, he was lifting more than me, but then again, I was pretty much a pleb slob learning how to lift.  Now, I'm lifting a whole lot heavier.  Anyways, when he's at the gym with us, he tries to lift the same weight as me, but it's clearly too heavy.  He doesn't get full reps and his form suffers.  It's hard to tell him what to do as he'll listen to you, but will never apply it.  Best examples are squats, as he'll quarter rep for 4 reps, and some of the machines, like lateral raise machine where he ends up lifting himself off the seat."

I want to do all the exercises prescribed twice a week which would mean 6 days a week. He says he recommends against this though, but I think I would be fine since I'm not lifting heavy ass weights for high reps like most of you guys are.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, would it be better for me to run the program as it says going 6 days straight or doing 3 days on 1 day off?

pretty fucking great tho
Are you cutting? Is your output higher?
2 months won‚Äôt show a lot but it‚Äôs hard for anyone to tell without photos or your written program and weights.
Do the people that struggle to shovel food into their mouth find cutting easy? Or does it suck bulking and then suck again cutting?
Yes most of what you lost was water and glycogen.
"wow, just literally dont eat that."

Should I cut for another 3 weeks or can I finally bulk now? I'm still bloated from adding carbs back and eating maintenance. I might go for the cut and reverse diet instead of eating back maintenance and blowing up too fast. Or I could lean bulk and possibly still lose the water weight. Let me know what you all think. http://imgur.com/a/vneESXg
"Yeah but I reccomend you deload this week to prevent over training, and then make sure you don't overtrain skip the gym on the days you're going to the gym so that you can safely train 7 days in a row.

I want to clarify I don't think AAS are safe, but I would argue that we have seen more cases of acute health issues from vaccines than AAS (in terms of take it and within a week you are hospital bed bound)

And I suppose my largest fear comes from the compounding effects that mixing steroids and the vacc *could* have.

That being said I have seen a lot of guys on BB forums say they have gotten both shots while on a blast and nothing happened, so some of it may just be a bit of irrational fear borne out of bad info"
"The greatest feeling you can get in a gym or the most satisfying feeling you can get in the gym is the pump. Let's say you train your biceps, blood is rushing in to your muscles and that's what we call the pump. Your muscles get a really tight feeling like your skin is going to explode any minute and its really tight and its like someone is blowing air into your muscle and it just blows up and it feels different, it feels fantastic. It's as satisfying to me as cumming is, you know, as in having sex with a woman and cumming. So can you believe how much I am in heaven? I am like getting the feeling of cumming in the gym; I'm getting the feeling of cumming at home; I'm getting the feeling of cumming backstage; when I pump up, when I pose out in front of 5000 people I get the same feeling, so I am cumming day and night. It's terrific, right? So you know, I am in heaven"

Honestly neither. Is anyone else a fan of this sport but doesn't actually lift themselves? I just feel like it would be really uncomfortable to be that size. Its cool they like pushing themselves that hard. I love to watch it. But im content with my skinny yogi body personally.
Every update looking better and better!
Sure from that perspective I get but I think there is a genuine curiosity that people have towards how much gear you had to run. Like I guarantee you guys in the olympia are not all running the same stuff and at different doses because it‚Äôs what works for them.

"thanks! 

Not yet, I'll pick one up eventually but I've got some house repairs we're working on first.

Next purchase will be a rowing machine (cardio) and a lying hamstring curl station. I can do hamstring curls right now with the cable but its awkward to get in and out of, I'd rather have a separate platform where Im not *attached* to the cable to use it. 

The wife wants a stair master and a new treadmill, so I'm sure we'll get those after that."

"I hope this is okay to ask in this thread, but I want to ask about creating a program for cutting season that involves running as cardio.  

Right now I'm running a bro split with two leg days (Wed: Quads/calves, Saturday: hams/calves).  I don't intend to really change this up.  

I want to include running as cardio instead of walking on a treadmill or stairmaster.  How can I incorporate running into my training effectively?  I'm assuming, if we stick to the ""500cal deficit per week to lose 1lb of fat"" and the ""1 mile = 100 cals"" then aim to run 5 miles a week?  I know there'll be days where I do 3.1miles or even longer, how should I account for that?  Just eat more on those days to make up the extreme deficit?"

Sorry about your dog. What's going on?
"You can lose weight if you diet properly with no drugs, you‚Äôre not dieting properly. If you can‚Äôt lose weight at 260lbs you‚Äôre not even trying.  The amount of extra calories you‚Äôd burn with lifting and cardio is fairly negligible compared to how much you could simply drop from diet alone.

Weigh all your food, track all your calories and macros, find out your TDEE(better to underestimate than overestimate it) and eat 500cals less than that."

I‚Äôd say a half vacuum is a good way to describe it. He sort of sucks his abs in but you can‚Äôt see the rib cage jutting out with everything else drawn in like a typical vacuum. Maybe he just didn‚Äôt practice the vacuum enough for it to look really good but it‚Äôs probably just that he was too big to pull it off well
"trainedbyjp: super fucking cool insight on the boards cuz you see some crazy cycles. the training and all that stuff is interesting and fun, but tbh i mostly like the forum and running through his thoughts on the videos he has on all the compounds. not super expensive which is a plus

john jewett: havent personally gone in, but this is a lot different. this is like a certification, your learning and running through an actual course which means its expensive, i believe 600$. but he actually goes into depth on a lot of things including gear apparently so probably super fucking cool if money doesnt mean much and you want the knowledge.

HC: i love joe, you should 10000% use the free trial. its mostly training, you pick a program to run and it has its own log book to enter into for you. lot lot lot of training videos for stuff, thought process behind a lot of stuff, forum board, and a little other stuff like diet. i dont remember seeing any gear talk on there. i enjoyed listening to him talk about his prep for nationals in 2018. a little pricey (25$) to be paying monthly tho, better monthly price (12.50$) if your committed for a year. 

my personal favorite that ive been subbed to for awhile now is B Chavez's: its almost completely gear talk, and has hundreds and hundreds of hours if not over a thousand hours of content. just getting through the Q&amp;As takes awhile alone, but the fucking greatest part is every question is time stamped so you can just scroll through, find the questions you like, and listen to those only. the madsen files was literally recorded coaching calls, you can go through those and see all of the thought process behind their adjustments on diet, training, and gear.  the after freedom podcast archive is also great, its where i first really learned about him and has tons of info and i believe the podcast is off everywhere except his members site now cuz i think the guy got in legal trouble (AUS). his dieting concepts are so extremely simple its not something you need to deep dive here if thats your interest. his training is the same, its not something your signing up for. want tons of interesting takes and info on gear? this is the place to go"
"Man I just got banned from my gym for something I didn't do, they told me they had me on camera and that I was the last person going into the back room and it was completely trashed when they saw it, but I never even once went into the back room, that legitimately was not me going back there, they sent me a text and told me not to come back, what a sad day"
Yeah bro you can totally put on that much muscle in two years
"It won‚Äôt increase your metabolism IMO, but it will have an effect on nutrient partitioning so if you are training heavily and eating at a surplus you will gain more muscle than fat. Don‚Äôt get me wrong tho, you can definitely get fat still"
yeah I'm hoping to focus more on powerlifting and maybe compete if possible btw if as of rn I can't squat with a squat rack is it possible to just compete in deadlift and bench?
LMFAOOAAOAO IM DEAD. Should‚Äôve put that for the banter. And I have a bunch of protein products such as quest chips and stuff. Think I should be good hopefully
Seen that video before. I do like the look of that split. You think something like that can be used for years to pretty much get most of your gains?
Thanks man I appreciate the write up. I'd never cheat but I'm starting to see why people do it. I'll give this a try with her and see what happens. Definitely havent been pulling my weight as of late in the relationship.

If you want to take your physique to the next level then do it. Dial in your diet more, increase intensity of training, and prioritize recovery more. Consistency is key.


 That's all there is to it. Sounds easier said than done though. Maybe hire a coach if you are struggling to progress. Good luck."

"Yeah, it may not be polite to say, but Chris' appearance makes him a lot more marketable than the other top competitors. And I think the IFBB cares about marketability even more so for classic than for other divisions, since classic seems to be their ticket to making bodybuilding more mainstream. As much as it sucks though it's not too likely to change, as far as back Arnold's day their have been shenanigans to have the preferred competitor on top, and pretty much every long reigning Mr O other than Lee Haney has had a controversial win."

Thanks.  Makes sense.
That‚Äôs also a pretty good philosophy for farting
"Honestly, start lifting. Learn the techniques and keep it simple. Then I would eat maintenance for a while, say a month until you've nailed the techniques 
Don't fuxk around with lots of different things 

Depending in your split, squat, leg press, deadlift RDL, bench press, incline bench and dips, row, pull down, press, lat raise, 1 or 2 bicep or tricep movements (standing curl, spider curl; pushdown, Kickback). Even that's pushing it, but you don't need any more. 

After you got them mastered, bulk. Wheb you begin lifting you have a huge chance for gains. Begin pushing your numbers up, more reps, more sets, or more weight. Really push yourself  
In 9 month or a year if you've packed on size, cut but do so SLOWLY. Be patient but have a plan."

I'll start to get rid of any foods I'd crave around 4-6 weeks out and make the gf just get them when she wants them, otherwise I think the fact that it's almost physically impossible to feel full at this body fat and stage helps a lot.

Without the promise of satisfaction from cheating or binging why bother at all?

But there are moments where it consumes you and distractions are key, as well as knowing when to feed yourself back up if self-coached rather than continue to fight the body.

Luckily for me the things I want involve lots of prep or ordering which I couldn't bring myself to do and as quite an adept cook I make lots of super tasty macro friendly stuff so it's not all boring bodybuilding stuff.

At worst I want to binge high protein bread as I love the taste haha"
Cool cool cool just realized I've been doing military press not OHP aka no bounce. Shits been tough asf. Also I've been doing facepulls wrong apparently. Big day for me.
thx
Fucking hell yeah dude
"I hate hip thrusts just because it's such a pain in the ass (pun not intended) to load and unload the weights, and getting in and out of position haha."
Goodnight sweet prince
Thanks man! I appreciate it and I take all the negativity as a grain of salt. Post show I‚Äôll post results

"Great idea....so, uhh, what sorta ratios of ingredients are we talking here so I can check my supplies. Like...what's the tren/100ml amount I should be putting in here?"
I think I technically dirty bulk. I have my scheduled meals that I won‚Äôt miss but will eat random snacks as well during the process.
Tell him his daughter likes your body and the hip thrusts really build your glutes and keep the bedroom spicy.
I‚Äôve had it before but no idea what it is

"Any kind of display of strength or physical activity on mainstream Reddit goes like this:

"I like to think I have shapely titties and my thing is variety. I would throw in a powerlifting style bench to start my workouts, something like a 5x5 or a pyramid to a heavy triple.

"I didn‚Äôt but I have definitely thought about it a lot. I still have a little loose skin,but over the years it has gotten significantly better. This is a good angle for me. It seems the more muscle mass and the leaner I get the better it looks.

"I actually have grown more hair??? Lol. And my hair has gotten thicker, hence the problem with ingrowned hairs after shaving"
Honestly the thing with high volume is it puts a lot of mental stress and you. With power building you get to have fun while making gains and growing strength. I really don't see why everyone doesn't do it.
"Even if I was interested in being friends with someone and wanted to talk with them, my answer would be ""no.""  The specificity makes it more intense than it needs to be to just spark up a conversation."

at the end of the day im ignoring all government covid restrictions. didnt get a shot? sucks for you. not my problem

"Thank you immensely for the response. Upping my protein won‚Äôt be an issue at all.

"Nice! We have an instagram if you're interested shoot us a follow (same as our username) , we'd love to watch your progress!"
I honestly like the combination of body/muscle and your eye brow poses! You really have a Greek god quality.
"Its something i struggle with as well.  Ultimately you have to compromise i think.  Top / competing bodybuilders will do LISS to preserve leg strength.  Amateurs and more all around athletes  stick to more proper cardio and just have shitty or less frequent leg days.  Personally i do PPLPPL* with the asterisk being that sometimes i skip the second leg day but always substitute a monster workout if i do so (long intense bike ride/run/hike, rock climbing, kayaking, or 18+ holes walking).   But i usually do 0 cardio on the first leg day and a light session the day before so i can get a solid workout in.    Squeeze in 3-5 lighter cardio sessions / week ( 5k run, 15k bike, pick up sports kinda thing)."
"He used to have decent lower lats, especially in 2016-2017. Seems like they regressed."

Cbum 2020 is far superior than arnold. His proportions are much better than Arnold as he was shoulder/chest dominant only.
"But it's also better than ""omg help i cant workout at all"""
"yeah thats what im doing rn, 250 surplus and then when the weight gain stalls for more than a week just up by 250 again. also just to make sure ive got everything right, does it matter what those calories consist of? as in as long as i get a high amount of protein and throw in a good portion of fruits and veg, i can do whatever with the rest right?"
Yeah anything by Vlad Yudin is pretty trashy. I‚Äôm kind of sick of that guy having the monopoly on all bodybuilding content.
"[This is the ideal male body. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.](https://i.imgur.com/aPyDkD5.png)"
"I would pick which one you actually want to compete in long-term and focus on that. You can be fairly lean and not look like shit and compete in powerlifting, but that won't get you as far in bodybuilding as you'd probably like. You will also get plenty strong in bodybuilding, there are so many competitors that are moving big, big weights in the gym without putting their focus on maximal strength. 

Also, I consider ""powerbuilding"" to just be good, general strength training for anybody who isn't advanced enough to need to focus on one style of training or the other. It's just a term that means getting strong in powerlifting movements while also adding muscle mass in other areas and not neglecting muscle groups like biceps and side delts that are often lagging in strength athletes. If you take any typical bodybuilding program and do a squat, bench press, or deadlift variation in heavier rep ranges at the beginning of the work out, voila, you have powerbuilding. It's not magic."
"It‚Äôs crazy cuz I track my calories in order to eat enough, not even to lose weight (currently). I‚Äôm constantly eating and I‚Äôm very deliberate with my meals. And I have a friend who sees this behavior and multiple times has commented on it. ‚ÄúAre you anorexic?‚Äù ‚ÄúI think you might have a disorder‚Äù and that sort of thing

Funny thing is before I developed this ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù I was 140lbs @ 6‚Äô1‚Äù. Much healthier, right? 

Weird ass social norms"
"Hard to say, really. I'm not aware of any decent way to estimate. But you can see the vague outline of abs, and veins here and there. I think high teens at the most, and could be less because my back and legs look leaner."

"Hey, a well tailored suit on a bulking guy will look sick. Just don't take off the shirt haha."
I would highly recommend the kidney supplement from Revive MD and replace the milk thistle with TUDCA if you can. Milk thistle does not have good bioavailability.

"I‚Äôm pretty confident  I can feel them working when I run back day (currently gamma bomb). I use weight I can control, squeeze the muscle, but maybe more unilateral work would do it justice. 

I‚Äôm limited in equipment until i get my second vaccine shot, but beefyunicorn sent me a video yesterday of how to use the bands in a pull up bar for a unilateral pull down I‚Äôm going to incorporate. 

Lately when JM calls for unilateral work for pull downs I just sub in pull ups because, that‚Äôs all I have for a vertical pull motion.

Obvi I could just be really under developed or I could just be sloppy in form."
Thank you! My IG is Cosminfit
"Yeah, Devon was hardcore fanboying his hand/wrist strength and size, haha."
"I wouldn't bother with viagra for lifting because it gives me annoying sides (stuffy nose, headache). Cialis feels good in the gym. For seggs they both work, cialis lasts way longer though so no pressure as far as using the 3 hour viagra window. I like low doses, 6mg cialis 30mg viagra. Viagra is also substantially cheaper."
"Ima have to try that out, I am lazy as hell when it comes to cooking chicken"
Idk I just can‚Äôt do as much weight as I was at my home gym and I just feel like shit a lot of the time. Could just be the change of setting but I‚Äôm not sure why it is.
The worse part is the pre-workout at 4:45 am
The development is good ! I‚Äôm natty to and it‚Äôs just hard to get a super thick back not on the sauce . To me it looks like you could ‚Äúopen up‚Äù the back more if that makes sense

"Haha thanks so your main suggestion for me would be just to massively cut? Any idea on where to start? 

&gt; 4 years? Consistently? Slaving for 2 hours each and every workout? Bullshit

4 years consistently yes. Between 3 and 4 years. The 2 hours is a little bullshit. Only since gyms reopened during corona and there's nothing else to do but go to the gym that I've been going for 2 hours at a time.


&gt;**You look like shit** because there's something you're not doing right and there's no way you're being consistent with everything

Thank you, I agree."
Probably a solid 40-50lbs
Thanks for the PTSD
The classifications are all confusing except for open and 212. Shut down classic and men‚Äôs physique. Make it 3 or 4 weight classes and that‚Äôs it. Something like 185 to 200 ‚Ä¶ 200 to 220 ‚Ä¶ 220 to 250 and 250 + ‚Ä¶. Or come up with clarity on what classic is and what physique is .

It‚Äôs amazing how so many of them will happily inject themselves with synthetic hormones cooked up in some bushwack lab on a daily basis but draw the line at getting a vaccine that has been developed by top scientists and successfully administered to millions of people at this point.

Yeah early 20s* true
"Does not look like a row at all to me lol, I'd say it's a pretty good form."
"Backed off my lifting intensity after burning out and tweeking my back. 

I'm getting back to consistent lifting using a full body push/pull split every other day. Push is chest, quads, tris, shoulder press, and calfs.  Pull is lats, hams, bis, upright rows, and face pulls. 

I'm taking it easy but I really like it so far."
"Get ready for a serious amount of downvotes from the butthurt...but I don‚Äôt know why the majority of bodybuilding fans on this Reddit forum don‚Äôt admit that these guys just looked aesthetically better. Women were going nuts for these guys back then. The mass monster thing is awesome from a scientific point of view because these guys today are maximizing their genetic potential, but these older guys were flat out more aspirational and pleasing to the average eye. It was ‚Äúwow, he looks amazing‚Äù, rather than, ‚Äúwhat the f*** is that‚Äù. At 23 years old, we grew up watching the Terminator and Apollo Creed in Rocky and going ‚Äúdamn I want to look like that‚Äù, then Dorian Yates came and changed the game up and rightfully so because he wanted to WIN.

From Dr. Mike Isratels, 6 - 10 hard sets are enough weekly for consistent gains. Would 3x8-12 of the following be enough, chosen carefully? Or is there something I'm not thinking about?  
3x per week, 3x8-12 of each:  
\- 2x Legs excercises (Squat, Deadlift)  
\- 2x Chest/Shoulder excercises (Bench, OHP)

"You can keep trying to insult me for asking you to prove your claims, it's not making *me* look bad."
I used to do that but individually scoop each supplement into my shaker when it came time to go. I used to add those calorie free water flavor tube things if I had any lying around (I usually didn't tho)

You‚Äôre fine. I eat like 240g of protein at 140 lbs. protein is hard to convert to fat and is not actually bad for your kidneys if you‚Äôre healthy.
Just found his profile looks like he does that constantly hahah. Half his videos he just goes from giant shirt to shirtless in a second then works out. Me if I‚Äôm ever that aesthetic.

"Damn, the BMI cutoff in my country is 40+. 25 as a cutoff seems low."
Thanks my man! I think my bicep veins would still pop up even if I was at a 30% bodyfat haha.
I'm curious as to why you want to stay light? Is it a weight class issue?
"Ah damn you caught me I‚Äôm lying about it on a reddit sub..... lmao yes I‚Äôm seriously natty, why the hell would I lie about it here?"
Right now is the single best time to sell a used pickup truck than in the last 10+ years. Man some of the trucks at auctions with fucked up engine and transmissions are selling today at wholesale for what they what have sold for at retail last year.
Totally agree. Not to mention the fact that he showed up on the Olympia stage wearing my grandpa‚Äôs diaper. Despicable!
You look amazing brother!!
My arms feel ready for more a few hours later
"In Ig too. People are so dumb, I swear."
"Ignore the A/B (that's just my way of saying that you have 2 splits which you alternate). 

I'm just confused since you mentioned upper/lower type split despite mixing upper &amp; lower on every workout."
It's not fun I'll tell you that for free.

"Yeah i think they just go it alone actually, i think motherfuckers have bee guessing for decades. Every ""proffessional"" has just been guessing based on who came before who guessed on who came before who guessed on who came before...

 Because theres no fucking way any medical professional would be ok well these guys doing the amount of junk they do over this long a time.

Everyone on this forum scoffs when a classic body builder or past time dude say he only did some tiny amount, i think maybe they arent lying and the modern idea is to just slam as much juice as they can. Well now all these guys are dead... It would take a huge amt of mental gymnastics to not connect the dots."
"Yeah the thing is my performance in the gym isn't getting worse or anything, it's just my day to day life but by the time the gym comes around I can grind out the workout. 

Cause day one is only deadlifts day two is my base day with medium volume and day three is a pump day without the heavy compound (barbell squats) with lesser volume, so it's barely manageable lol. 


Idk I'll have to see bro I'll obviously pull back if it gets too much."
Lol. I do agree. I never said it builds muscle. Just sends a signal man. Thank you tho.
That's trt family pack or sth? Great progress bro but 500mg isn't trt.
whos willing to go half on this lol
"Back when I used to follow scooby like 7 years ago, he made a set of videos of him on a triathlon and how he managed his diet to lose as less muscle as possible"
Its not the most urgent thing in my life - although Ive heard greats things from people i know who say they wish they wouldve done it earlier lol
"IME any time you really want to feel a muscle work, just don't give it any rest during the set, and pause at the point where the contraction is the greatest. eg. lateral raises, pause at the top where arms are parallel with ground, and don't let them completely relax at your sides at all during the set"
"Air is pretty tasty at this point üòÖ. Right now I‚Äôm doing 3 ‚Äúmeals‚Äù and 1 snack.  Majority of meal is some sort of leafy green, or shiritaki noodles, just enough super lean protein and depending on my workout timing, a little added fat. Pickles/ cucumbers and sugar free jello are helping when I need it."
Surely it was /u/Broligarchy?
"You do understand what a fucken joke is? These white guys look ridiculous painted darker than the black guy in the group. I don‚Äôt care, other than to ridicule a rather silly practice.

I got good results from decline dumbbell press. Focus on contracting the pec.
Looking solid. Wish you well at your show!
"lmao naw i think we both know that theres a lot we disagree on but theres not much else we can do besides add anecdotal evidence which we both recognize as not that great for convincing arguments. 

side note, do you know who wes watson is?"
I got into an argument with my partner over this. He still thinks it‚Äôs to wash away dirt dispite me showing evidence of it being related to starch‚Ä¶ I could show him this thread and he would still deny it. Odd hill to die on but ok ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

"Perfect, thanks. I've been dealing with tendonitis since August so I'm really looking forward to some relief.  It's improved drastically with rehab working and a tailored exercise selection, but some days I still get some nagging pain and I'd just love to be done with that shit."

"Hey man I commented in the original thread when it was posted responding to the 2nd highest comment about your acne.

Stunning.
Thank you mate!
"No way it‚Äôs def simeon panda.

Post your physique.  Would love to see it.
"idk, hope there's lots of thotties in thongs though"
I'll admit that was the technique that I was using but I'll admit I've never been sure about how to really pull it off.
"I hit legs today, how the fuck are you supposed to front squat more than 135 without literally being choked out?"
Linked the heart at least lmao
"Been lifting for 4 years and pretty much only make progress if I train with really high intensity, but wow my body isn‚Äôt made for this shit at all. Every 3-4 weeks training like this I just end up tired af and unmotivated to lift until I take a week off, even when I‚Äôm bulking üòû"
Gotta ask... What's the routine and diet like for a 12 year old?
"Man won the heisman, whatever he‚Äôs doing seems to be working haha"
"But, is it better than vanilla?"
Fair enough
"Yeah. Warm up with hamstring curls.

Anecdotally, you could also strengthen your knees with light weight walking lunges 2x a week. Using a more narrow squat stance also prevents my knees from hurting, personally."
"Ok well I don‚Äôt know enough about mma or boxing. Why isn‚Äôt there a set rules for points? That‚Äôs dumb.

A knockout should be a specific point."
"I agree it's lame when people lie about their (un)-natty status.

They arrested him because he had a full gym during a pandemic. It‚Äôs dickheads like this that are the reason I had to close my business.
"No way is right. He keeps it at an rpe
of 7 after the first set and the last set is a pause set. 5 reps, 20 second pause, repeat until failure.  

Just not my style of training. I like to pyramid 3 good sets with a warm up set with the last set being a failure dropset. The first exercise was lying leg curls and it took 25 minutes to complete, all four took two full hours. A long workout is 80 minutes for me. 

I just wanted to give it a try as a challenge, and it was indeed challenging and exhausting, but I was losing focus and interest by set 4."
nah dude.  i was coming at it from a start of like 310 if that gives more context
why are you hesitant to use them?
welcome to bodybuilding and not spinning your wheels
"I'll never be able to figure this shit out for the life of me. I eat the same things, sleep the same and one day I look like shit the next day i look amazing. I didn't even workout the last three days because of the second dose i got"
That was like his 45th account.
"They‚Äôre challenging to isolate heavy. I love training adduction directly for a pump and to help your squat, but a deep leg press or squat will do a lot more to add mass."
"I‚Äôm sorry but for being 5‚Äô5 you don‚Äôt look like you lift. Bump up the calories, volume, weight, and ask again in 3 years minimum. Bodybuilding is a game of enjoying the process"
"Definitely expecting it too soon. Keep training and trust the process. 

By the time you're repping 225 for 10 I guarantee your chest will look different than it does now"
Damn man. I was following your progression too. Sorry to hear about the cancellation. Any new plans?
I think so but like my analogy about tattoos it's incredibly painful and incredibly expensive
Why is it recommended *not* to workout? I was at a concert the next day when I got most of mine

You‚Äôll be sorely disappointed as someone who doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing lifting wise and also being that body fat. Sure go do your 500mg beginner cycle and get back to us with your sick results lol.
"That's super fair. I wasn't specifically referring to you with that comment either. If someone adopts a regular English or otherwise acquires one without paying a breeder that's fine, the dog can't be 'unborn' and deserves care too, and I wasn't about to assume where you got your dog even when I thought it was an EBG."
Thanks man! I enjoy training at the gym. Look forward to it most days.
Yes I agree with you
I appreciate the feedback!
That seems like pretty standard stuff per serving to me. Besides the fact that there‚Äôs a long list of nutrients (that you may or may not even need) I don‚Äôt see anything that stands out here.
Thank you! That‚Äôs the fuckin plan üëäüèΩ
"Whats everyone's favorite exercises to warm up your legs? I usually start with a seated leg press and increase the weight after each set, usually 4 sets, feels like it hits all the major muscles to get me going. Wanted to see what everyone else is doing."
Thanks bro!
"Your coach sounds like an idiot. 8 weeks is not long enough for a prep unless you‚Äôre already shredded which I doubt you are. You also have no business running tren unless you‚Äôre women‚Äôs physique or bodybuilding, which considering your goal weight is 125 at 5‚Äô10 you sound an awful lot like a bikini competitor. So basically you‚Äôre gonna be taking the most toxic drug possible while on a diet that isn‚Äôt long enough for you to get lean. All while you‚Äôre still doing coke and xanax. Get clean, find a new coach that doesn‚Äôt want to put you on tren, and pick a later show date."
"Okay, so I tested my Bulgarian split squat (70 kg BW, by the way). 

75 kg (165 lbs) moved pretty slowly.

85 kg (187 lbs) was a battle.

Tried 90 kg (198 lbs), couldn't lock out, felt a bit deflated.

So I got psyched up for 10 minutes, went for 90 again, and just about finished the longest, most spasmodic rep of my life.

At least I know I couldn't have gone heavier..."
"It's crazy you're getting as many upvotes as you are, considering you're just throwing out some insults combined with statements lacking any logic to back them up. That's reddit sometimes though man.

That being said, of course the rumors for Ronnie's 2003 gear use are insane. It's the most impressive version of any bodybuilder to ever hit the stage. People want to think it's drugs because they want to believe they can access a similar level of mass or at least a fraction of it. People can't. Look at Boston Loyd. Guy pumped grams and grams of gear until his kidney's failed. The guy still looks meh.

And the vast majority of people would look meh too doing the same thing."
Yeah I don't agree with him.
Looks good. Kinda lame but good to see you smiling in posing photos. Too many people around here pose looking absolutely miserable and the stage presence will be attractive.
Fucking LOL

"Great suggestion regarding the beginner splits! Bodybuilding.com has some good ones. Regarding the macros, I wouldn‚Äôt focus on this for a beginner. Just focus on eating relatively healthy and to meet your caloric needs to gain weight steadily. Macros are great, but not worth the effort especially for beginners."
Yeah exactly.  You are doing very well. Happy gains.
"Getting lucky doesn't equate knowledge bro. It just doesn't no matter what you argue. He was also speaking in long term, which you just mentioned he cited."
All these people saying Arnold is their hero obviously haven‚Äôt been following his socials or anything since these have been his politics. Dude believes in the masks and the vaccine. He posted and IG video weeks ago about this shit

"Well then‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Change that shit back."
"Haha. I appreciate the words. Spoken like someone with lots of wisdom and gains to match.

Good luck with the comp!"

"They're at their weakest point on stage. Months of dieting and leading up to the show they take in very little to no water within a couple days of stepping on stage. Not doing everything perfectly can lead to severe cramps, light headedness, and in some severe cases loss of consciousness. After Rhoden won the Olympia in 2018, he was so exhausted he could barely walk and needed someone to help him walk around off stage. That's the price you pay for extreme conditioning."
Thanks bro
"Dickhead. They aren't doing it to be selfish. Ofcourse you are too thick to realise that the world is not against you. And women having an exclusive area in a gym is not a prejudice against men. It's for someone to improve their health and life.
You can come back like a cry baby and complain that women are slefish and should stay at home when equal pay for them is sorted.

The problem is if you plan around only that excess then find out you need to take a 15 minute walk youve fucked it up. Might as well go over that margin and gain the muscle and potentially some fat.

No. I fucking get it. I know what it's like to not have the motivation to be productive. I know what its like to not leave your house for weeks and I know how hard it is to get back on track. Im not trying to be a dick but if you can order a bunch of frozen meals to your house and throw them in the microwave you can order some chicken breast and throw them in the oven. Youre obviously passionate about fitness and proper nutrition so take that first step and do something simple that makes you feel good.
"Yeah I get that, but I just want to continue doing this without enhancements but still being able to pass drug tests to do so competitively"
What do you expect when you juice and abuse your body? We all share the same sized heart
"Imagine being one of those insecure simps that write those ""clearly on juice"" comments, just to feel better. Its not ""definitely/clearly"" its ""maybe"" 

Dont act like your able to spot if someone is natty or not through a picture with a pump and good lighting. Thats pathetic."
No idea. Mom got it from some Greek place in town.
Yes at some point i will take anabolics to exceed my genetic limit . Might be my opinion but i dont think that you can truly be a bodybuilder without drugs . Can you look fucking amazing ? Absolutely but competitively being at 5-6%bodyfat only looks good (in my opinion) when on drugs . Still i think one should get the majority of there natural gains so that they dont need 3g of tren to get bigger . If your genetic limit is 170lbs at 5%bodyfat . Maybe get to 160-165lbs at 5%bodyfat And then take drug . If you start at 140lbs then what the hell are you gonna do to pass 200?
Yeah mine can do flat Incline and decline. Its just the leg attachments that I wish I'd spent the extra ¬£50 on

"Ah the old dirty bulk without counting calories. I made the same mistake a couple of times and I'll probably do it again.

Sadly if you've been overweight before the dirty bulk usually turns out to be the ""get fat"" bulk.

The sensible route would be at least to monitor your weight weekly and check that you are not gaining faster than you should because it'll be just extra fat."

Especially Noel's he's a really big role model for me and he really does motivate me to do better. And Joe has the most likable personality of any fitness influencer out there. It would feel great to be training along side my idols. 

Any thoughts or opinions on these sort of things please let me know ‚ù§Ô∏è"

"Thanks bro! I appreciate the support. I still have a bit of body dismorphia which sucks, I always see myself as fat and have a phobia of gaining fat. But I know it‚Äôs in my head (I hope?) lol. I measure as accurately as possible and believe I‚Äôm at 9-10%bf, but I see lots of guys posting pics where they‚Äôre like 15-20%bf saying they‚Äôre 10% and it makes me stress out wondering how off I am. But thanks man"

Upper chest? Im guessing you want to see that seperation on your side chest? You‚Äôll have to lose more weight if thats the case to see it better.
"Thanks man, quietly been grinding and good to finally see what was under the fluff.

Yeah that sounds like a good approach, agree i need a lot in the upper body especially to even think about nationals. Competing would spotlight my weaknesses vs the amateur competition in the UK (which i think is strong so will be motivating as hell to grow) so would be helpful.

Thanks for your input mate, most skip to criticism rather than helping with the question haha."

"You are looking great girl! Since you are 5 weeks out, the best thing you can do is PERFECT your posing to hide your weak areas and create a symmetrical physique. You will need to work on adding more muscle to your delts, glutes and calves in your off season. 

I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre doing bikini? It‚Äôs all about the X frame. If you don‚Äôt already have one, find a great posing coach. It‚Äôs really getting to that crunch time. You need to work on your lower back flexibility and never drop your glutes on stage. There are girls, especially novice bikini, that take 1st place because they know how to pose on stage, they exude confidence, don‚Äôt look nervous on stage &amp; come in with a great package (hair, make up, bikini, flawless tan). Best of luck!"

"&gt; I feel like I'm being laughed at in the gym when I try and bench press or do an inclined bench press.

this is your insecurity speaking. nobody gives a fuck about you in the gym, they have more important things to care about like themselves and their own workout. if you cant do the bar, do dumbbells. if you can do the bar, work on that and add 2.5kg a side each time, not 5kg."
Good. Pro tan is better. They‚Äôll do your face and they should be back stage fixing tans before you go on. You shouldn‚Äôt have to do any of that yourself.
"Yeah, people saying it‚Äôs fat haven‚Äôt seen this pic. I hate to be this guy but youve been hit with the cursed waist genetics. I would know, I have them too lmao. But yeah it‚Äôs the size of the actual bone, not much you can do unless you‚Äôre considering black market Belarusian hip filing surgery. 

As the other guys have said training lats help to fill out the space above the curve but you‚Äôre not gonna get the V shape. Our best hope is the l l shape. 

There are people like terry crews who have wide hips and you can see that he just can‚Äôt get the V shape despite having an insane amount of muscle, being shredded and not natty."

Squats are superior to leg presses for a total leg workout. It also includes a core workout because you have to stabilize as you go into your squat. I am fairly certain that leg press does not work the quads as well as squats.

"I doubt that either one is better than the other.

"You said ""it doesn't matter if muscle or fat"".

I disagree that extra muscle mass HEAVILY taxes your organs.

"Appreciate it. I know my legs grow faster then my upper body. But if you look at old photos, my upper body has came in so much compared to my legs over the last couple years.

I'm someone that constantly struggles with sleep, and lately, besides having a little better sleep hygiene, I've been trying a combination that seems to be helping a bit:

* 2 hours or so before going to bed: 185mg magnesium bisglicinate, 300mg KSM-66 ashwaganda.
* Half an hour before bed: same as above plus 200mg l-theanine.

If it's stress related you can also try lavender extract, it has some evidence that it helps in that context."

"6'-7"" here so I definitely have some experience here with the long limbs and size.

Your upper body is looking awesome.  Most guys don't know how difficult it is to look ""big"" when you're that tall.  Bodybuilding really favors guys that are shorter than 6'-0"".  At 190 lbs you're definitely already very lean and in 12 weeks I would imagine you're going to have to push to lose those last like 8-10 lbs.

The biggest thing to focus on after the show is size ESPECIALLY in your legs.  I'm 215 lbs and I'm probably the same size as you up top but my legs are bigger.  You've got a crazy amount of potential but go all out on leg day during your bulk and you'll even out your proportions really nicely.

EDIT: Do a bunch of shrugs too.  You have awesome shoulders and getting the traps up would round you out nicely."
At this point I'm pretty sure that if bloods aren't done in the next week or two that you and /u/iSkeezy are literally going to put me in jail

"If you find you reach volitional failure before concentric failure, there are a number of techniques you can use to prevent this.

First of all, stay calm. Breathe deep into your gut and brace your core for every rep. 

Secondly, it's not always better to use a mind-muscle connection. If you focus instead on the external physics of the actual movement, rather than the contraction of the target muscle, you will get, on average, more reps."

"&gt;  Bodybuilders can use PEDs to improve themselves as opposed to recreational drug use where the entire purpose is temporary pleasure.

Eh......

From a purely medical standpoint it could be argued that it's doing more damage than good to the body, and that bodybuilding at a high level is a merely hedonic aesthetic pursuit. 

Let's not kid ourselves - blasting tren and squatting 800 isn't exactly going to do wonders for anyone's health or longevity, it's not exactly swimming and moderate cardio is it..."

I don't think its a huge deal per se, however, there should be a notable enough difference in what the judges are looking for."
Anyone heard of or used superior mass from Superior14? It has Halal cert so its very appealing to me but I never used it before.. not to be mistaken with serious mass

That meet was a really great time and there were a lot of memorable things that happened, what event did you compete in?"
"Years ago I injured my wrist so I ordered a wrist wrap online that was specifically for wrist injuries (it basically held your wrist straight, it was not meant for working out). I would use it on chest days and it really helped. I thought I was going to have to use it forever, but eventually my wrist healed completely and built strength and now I don‚Äôt need it anymore. Maybe try that. Also look up proper wrist form, if you‚Äôre bending/rolling your wrist you are more prone to injury and it can definitely hurt someone with a prior wrist injury. 
  
If you‚Äôre new to working out then stick to lighter weight until your wrists get accustomed to the extra weight, but if they hurt from push-ups then I‚Äôm not sure what the issue is.
  
Also, this is not the proper sub for these questions and some people will probably downvote you. Just so you know. sorry I don‚Äôt know the name of the correct sub off the top of my head"

Yes Arnie is the face of bodybuilding but there was a lot of fucked up things going on during his career. 1975 Serge was banned until the day of the show to fuck his conditioning, 1971 he was the ONLY competitor so he won by default, in 1980 he showed up looking ass and won by default. He was actually disqualified by a judge that show for not hitting proper poses and that judge was immediately taken off the panel and sent home. 4 of the 7 other judges were Arnold‚Äôs personal friends! Also, in 1970 they couldn‚Äôt decide between him or Sergio so Arnold agreed with Sergio they‚Äôd both walk off stage while the decision was made. But Arnold immediately turned back around and pointed to Sergio walking off showing that he ‚Äúquit‚Äù and started posing again and won the show. What a fucking asshole. Also I‚Äôve heard before he asked for black backdrops at shows when competing against black competitors he thought could rival him so he‚Äôd pop more but their complexion would fade into the background."

"Yeah, everyone has a different percentage they like to quote about how much diet plays a part into abs which is conveniently why they never have to train them. I may not be a BB legend or even anywhere close, but I'm going to tell you why that's bullshit:

- you should be following a decent diet ANYWAY. It's not like anyone taking their physique seriously is going to say ""I can eat garbage because I did some crunches so we'll call it even."" Naw. Is diet a major part of it? Absolutely, but your diet is a major part of your physique in general. I'm not giving up pizza and fried chicken solely on the basis of my abs.

- your core and everything it consists of is a muscle much the same as anything else, and people really notice a well-defined core. Nobody takes that same attitude about another group. ""Well if I just diet I don't have to work the tris because they'll get worked through compound exercises."" Sounds absurd, right? Because it is.

But I suppose if I had to pick just one exercise, I'm partial to reverse crunches. Lower abs are a problem for many people, myself included. Your upper abs and obliques will receive SOME work over the course of your day-to-day as a stabilizer and accessory, but it's the lower abs that usually get left out."

3) Thanks for pointing out calves &amp; abs (although who gives a shit about abs). Also I've already been considering RDL :)

3) I'm not sure about the triceps, quads &amp; hammy thing tho. I believe in heavy compund exercises and I've seen beginner program with pretty much only the big 5. In addition, I'd rather stick to about 4 exercises per workout and go heavy on these (be in &amp; out of the gym within 40 mins). Would you say I need more than 1 triceps exercise per 12 exercises tho (I do have dips atm.)?"

With 30kg my posture suffers and I can't do it properly. Point is with woodchopper it really feels like doing low reps is impossible.

Physique is insane but I can't get over the fact that he's just working out with his shirt hanging around his waist lmao.
"Wrong sub, try one of the bf% subs"
"Damn I've never tried RDLs on the smith machine. You like it more than with BB? 

Ill give it a try next leg day"
The sub is for competitive bodybuilding. There are plenty of other places to post progress pics or talk about starting out
i saw my gym crush on Saturday..as she was leaving and I was reversing..She was exiting the gym took her mask off and smile. We def made eye to eye contact. I hope to you again
"Everyone saying your doctor will agree with her, but I‚Äôve had multiple doctors, a few on the older side, not worry about my creatine. For some reason one of the nurses put it on my medications list in my medical file lol. My endocrinologist even asked me if it helps or not, because it first became popular when he was in college."
Love it. Can‚Äôt eat it cos it stays crunchy and shreds the roof of my mouth. But literally like flavor crack when you eat it.
Looking great. Should have added other pictures to better see the difference.
"Agreed on bonac we just saw the same thing happen to rolley, nick is a monster no doubt but we haven't seen him stand with anyone great yet, Sergio is a beast but he must know something isn't quite right to miss the entire season. Iain must know how good he is guy is unreal atm, isn't he training in the same gym as nick atm? Cbum did a video with nick there a few weeks ago."
What do you mean with failure?
That‚Äôs like asking what is more important for a baby. Learning how to breathe or learning how to do its taxes

Yes.
"Hahaha, Someone get me a sitcom"
And they both placed highly well. But with Shaun looking like the scaled-down version of Ronnie Coleman it was a clear choice.
"Well me and steph were both slowly starving to death despite food choices so the beginning stages of recovery were to completely eliminate restriction and focus on restoring physical health. Once her refeed process ended im pretty sure she started slowly restricting again. Iirc she said her appetite reduced after a while and she didn't feel the need to binge on junk anymore so just ate small snacks when she wanted to.  
Idk what her mental struggles are but I know I'm all sorts of fucked up. I'm anorexic as well as orthorexic so if I had the choice I would eat nothing but a couple chicken breasts per day but also don't want to die next month. Im not really sure what the root of everything is yet but yeah it boils down to self view for pretty much all of us"

That is a wild guess as most 'wisdom' shared in the Bodybuilding community.
Yeah but 3rd place in classic novice and getting 2nd in open classic is weird af too
My cycle is something like 200 test e 200 mast e 200dhb and maybe 35mg ment a week that gets me easily to 99kg at 181cm with 6pack idont know the actual bf% who cares lol
"Yes I posted my placements with some stage shots! And thank you!

Unilateral movements and improve any mobility restrictions you have on the weak side. My left quad is smaller almost solely because that ankle has zero dorsiflexion and there is a bit of an internal rotation restriction on that side. Working on that has helped a good amount.

Read my post again you dipshit. I'm saying his facial hair and his hair style are distracting from his overall appearance. And if you think that doesn't matter when judging you're a moron who most likely never competed or been to a bodybuilding contest.
I'm no pro so take what I say with a grain of salt but imo I prefer bulking at a 200 cal surplus over 500. Felt like I just gained more fat at +500.

You aren't ready until your room is clean young man.
He will die for ‚Äúthe sport‚Äù. Fact!
My schedule is gonna be pretty rough this year. I might just make a bunch of extra food if I meal prep and just leave it in the fridge. That way I can still meet my tdee
Is that just to be safe or is that also the likelier scenario?
How much volume is in his workouts?? Lol have you tried eating more before training
"I did carb cycling during a cut with a diet from Justin Harris. Shit was tough. Low days were like 1900 calories at one point, then high days got up around 4000. It was like having a binge eating disorder, I was so hungry by the time I hit the high days I wanted to fucking eat everything in sight. That and the fact that every day was completely different in terms of food, so the amount of time spent meal prepping was annoying.

I‚Äôd love to give it a go again during a bulk one day, because I think there‚Äôs great potential there for better muscle growth, but honestly I got so turned off the idea after that and found a new coach who keeps me on the same calories all the time. The consistency of same calories every day has yielded significantly better results for me personally, but don‚Äôt let me turn you off the idea, you may love it"
You‚Äôre training legs wrong.
Low impact is better since you'd be better recovered for your leg workouts.
"Fuck that, remember to eat your meats, carbs, starches and take vitamins to make up for lack of veggies.

That back is sick. And you prob know this but put weakest point is prob arms.
"Bro, answer the question. How can he improve? If he is going to stagnate then hell yeah he should switch division. That‚Äôs the whole point of bodybuilding, to build up the body. To improve. To grow."
"In a new gym for this prep (big chain). Super weird to strip down to undies for posing practice in the classroom?

"Most dudes too. In certain circles. You should just go and do stuff that active people do. Like if you go to a club then you run into people who are into clubbing and social media, if you go to painting course, the people are people who paint etc."

I said this same shit about /r/brogress earlier. The comments are just excuse after excuse.
why no gurls like this at my gym..
"After a few years of training, I saved up and spent a bunch of money on some of those seminars by pros. I walked away with a six month plan to learn how to ‚Äútrain with intent.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think you have to do shit like that to grow, but it was a notable turning point in my training and I think it was worth it. My results were way better than any of the other shit I‚Äôd tried (Starting Strength, several BB.com programs, etc.).

I would say developing MMC should be a high priority for a beginner. It‚Äôs necessary for consistent form, which is necessary for every advanced bb technique."
Where can I read more about this anti vax shit I‚Äôm intrigued
Or maybe some politicians care more about getting votes from conspiracy dipshits than about public health.
Prep goggles are hitting hard. Feel like I look way too fat for 10.5 weeks out. Still getting a lot of compliments that just make me feel weird. But on the plus side I‚Äôm still setting PRs almost every workout. 2 plate decline press for 3 sets of 10 today. The big guys are starting to ask to work out with me and my partners. Going to Powerhouse to fuck up legs again with my training partner and one of the guys Saturday. Looking forward to being crippled for the rest of prep with all these people pushing me.
lol yeah not sure how to do front squats with dbs
Fuck that‚Äôs funny. I‚Äôll be 70 years old and still laughing at shit and farts
You posted this like 5 hours ago bro
it definitely looks like she's been cut out and placed on a different background
Im amazed that he still manages to have twigs for legs after like 500 days
"Definitely odd that you're experiencing such bad doms even though you've been training legs consistently. 

Only thing I can suggest is stretch and foam roll after the session, do some light cardio and get enough protein and rest in you. 

An ice bath might help if you can manage one."

The x files episode with the cannibal family freaks me out but as I type this in broad daylight waiting for a haircut I think I could take them. The greys are definitely easy to take in a fight I'd say."

I honestly loved seeing Luke in the ending of Mando. I think they did a great job of setting up how powerful the death troopers were and seeing Luke just obliterate them gave us a glimpse to what his power was supposed to be in the original extended universe.

Just a quick side note: Jeff Nippard is a social media personality. He exists for the sole purpose of getting views, hits, ad revenue, and affiliate sales. He's going to say stuff that is relatable so garner more online attention. New people HATE the idea of working out a major muscle group just once a week, ""more is better"" is so common with new people. Of course he's going to say some shit like every other day is fine.

I wasn‚Äôt jealous but couldn‚Äôt for the life of me figure out why they weren‚Äôt going at it. Hell, maybe they were. Then again, I‚Äôm a guys and girls can‚Äôt be just friends Harry met Sally type. It fucked with me. There were other fish in the sea."
"Problem is that in my area, it‚Äôs very difficult to schedule a session. Currently the next available PT session is in two weeks, which by then I can tell you my pain will almost 100% be gone"
Yes. You are very big for a natural junior. I dont know how small youd be after you diet but those guys are very small
"I get like sweaty palms even thinking about applying for jobs or interviewing, even tho I'm not even thinking of changing jobs just yet.

Anything you guys use to reduce this kind of anxiousness/nervousness?"
"Twista got banned on some random subreddit for being a retard. He tried to evade that ban by making new accounts, resulting in a permanent ban.

aaa got banned from here for being aaa. He tried to evade that ban by making new accounts, resulting in a permanent ban."
Man y‚Äôall making me feel good about 5‚Äô8 176
Honestly lmao why do they care.
They should of gang tackled that pathetic little cop
I mean you are starting to sound like one. I hope things start looking up for ya though.
Yeah he looks like a different person now for sure
"Probably could do well in wellness, if not better than bikini. You've got good size on hips and thighs."
Anybody wanna spitball some anxiety control methods with me? I‚Äôm at the end of my rope today (no pun intended) with this anxiety attack
You look a bit like Tommy Fury... If he had a mask on.
I just woke up and it took me a while haha
Will do! Thanks!
You look insane. Just get leaner and shave your armpits and you good to go lmao
"Unpopular opinion: Arm days are fun, especially when you have intensity techniques added in them."
"It‚Äôs good to be reminded of these things once in awhile. Even for training, there have been studies that come to the conclusion that x is better, but like a participant or 2 might get wise from doing x, and some participants doing y got better results than people doing x. Science is a good starting general point, but most importantly is finding what works for you. And I think you 100% on point for your diet. High carb, more protein if your less anabolically/genetically assisted, and lowish fat. Hope you grow like a weed man"
"Gymnasts, but they're all super manlets"
"Ohhhhhhhhhh okay wow, sorry, i think me and everyone else thought you meant actual real anadrol.

All of those supplements are bullshit. There's a reason why they're legal and there's a reason why popular online shops and places like GNC have to advertise them so hard and charge a huge markup for them.

Your money is honestly better spent making sure you hit your protein macros, or hell even some minimally-effective creatine would be better. Everything else is bullshit."
Mike Matarazzo would like to have a word...
Nice
"I'm no expert but my understanding is that it lowers DHT which is also linked to beard growth. Seems strange to prescribe that but they're the doctor, not me.

Minoxidil works well for patchy beards."
and u were right nearly broke my back and chin during weight traning look down
tends to be like that lol
That's quite a good reason to stay away from pinning them then lol
"Jesus Christ, why is every old guy super jacked?! -Morty"
Why are you trembling
I thought he had a piece of cheese on his ass
Its a great program
i‚Äôve been lifting for like 9 months now and for the first 6 months i had an ED where i‚Äôd only allow myself 1600 cals a day but for a few weeks i‚Äôd only 1000 cals. now i‚Äôve been bulking for the past 3 months and gaining weight rapidly. you guys think these are noobie gains kicking in or am i just getting fat? im only eating 300-400 above maintenance
Nick is no small dude and he is absolutely getting dwarfed
"I love that everyone's so invested in the cat story lol. He's okay!! Fed and loved. That piece is a work in progress, I'll get him."
I agree. I have friends who are deep in the covid shit and it doesn't really affect my opinion of them
"1500 is too low. For any adult. 

I‚Äôm relatively active (8-10k steps a day + lift 3/4x a week) female. 5‚Äô6 and this is around my maintenance calories"
Okay fair enough then.
"Thank you, I'll look into it."
Trust me I know what you mean. I look like I workout I'm bald with a beard and tatoos. But if I wanna talk about comic books or animated movies I watched I'll find someone who'll listen
"Yeah the difference is mad, I‚Äôve maxed out the lat pull down machine at my main gym and have just been increasing reps to almost 20 at 105kg. Trained at another gym a few weeks ago and was struggling to hit 12 reps with 91kg on their machine. Ego destroyed."
Whitexican? Lol
"Well shit, damn right pizza party, I'm down for that bb"
That fucking sucks man..
You look great
"Years.

You need to enjoy the process and do it for its own sake, not just try to reach the goal. It's a permanent lifestyle change not a plan."
"I'm preeeeetty sure it's in your inbox still.

It's pretty tight but I'm also just fat. I thought it was supposed to be pretty dang tight?
"And I mean who cares, some of your muscles got bigger!"
so it seems your cut is going well lol
Thank you for the reply. I'll check out Fouad's podcast I've heard great things about it
Yes

"I know it‚Äôs a joke, but goddamn do I hate hearing about his cookbook. It‚Äôs a bunch of generic thoughtless recipes"
"Just out of curiosity, are there any fitness or BB people who are notably left-wing? It seems like every single fitness person who talks politics is super right wing‚ÄîJim Wendler likes Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza, David Laid and Greg O‚ÄôGallagher are Trump supporters, Mark Rippetoe is a Trump supporting Covid skeptic... Are there any who are on the other side? I was kinda shocked when I saw David Laid post Qanon sex trafficking stuff on his story a while back. I wonder about people like Greg Nuckols or Jesse James West or Chris Bumstead. I remember Layne Norton saying Trump and his supporters were disgusting, but also that he hated Biden too lol. Would be funny if Jeff Seid was a big Bernie bro or something"
"Damn really crazy to think how different Zane looks compared to when he was younger, some people just look the same just with wrinkles and gray hair lol."
"Wow, so good!! üòç"
Because no way a ribeye has the former. Unless they harvested it from a cow kept in a concentration camp.
"Damn, can't believe how much of a difference that makes. Everything just feels so soft compared to before I got sick. Thank you for the response."
"I could have sworn I charged mine, but yesterday when I turned them on they said ""20%"". Luckily I was able to get through my workout by the time they died!"

"No use really in giving healing time with hypothetical tears. It also depends on the severity of the tear.

Again, please just go see a doctor if it's been bothering you for a month."
"Just started Week 5 of Gamma Bomb, and the amount of switching stuff up for almost-the-same-but-not-quite movements is keeping it consistently interesting. Progression has been consistent, and it's across all rep ranges as well.

I can only assume that the holidays helped significantly by ensuring I was *definitely* in a surplus, but by the same cause the water and fluff is currently hiding the Fizeek progress that was noticeable pre-Christmas üòÇ

Overall loving gamma Bomb so far, and really looking forward to the Leg Block starting Week 9 since they're already my best group, but they can and do always need to be bigger."
Look good but hard to tell with that pic. Throw some (wack) MP poses up.
Hahaha enjoy the treats then mate!
Damn well for me at least it doesn‚Äôt hurt. It‚Äôs just annoying
Pretty solid numbers tbh

"Agreed, and back! Cheers bro"
Lol anyone still use C4? I picked a tub up on sale bc it was cheap. Haven't used anything else in a few years but it's working fine for me.
Nah I'm on an air force base and other than EOD (who isn't allowed to do mcmap) it's just us Marines so I'll just have to wait for another red tab to show up

For me I struggled to put in multiple sets if there‚Äôs a TV nearby or I have my phone. Any fleeting thought that wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄòLIFT‚Äô would distract me intensely and I‚Äôd wander around till got focus again.
"Agreed.  I need heavy shit, and a majority of A7X ain't it."

Well men‚Äôs physique is a stupid category anyways.
"I'll think about that, thank you!"
Thanks! I will look into it!
Kinda hard to evaluate. What show has such a high weight cutoff for height.
"On a serious note bro you are, I can gaurentee 8/9 out of 10 dudes would either want or admire your work. On a body building aspect, probably not as much compared to other amateur and pros but thats like comparing apples and oranges. Its possible but different.


Keep up the good work man"
"Thanks bro, ex fatty so I don't usually train them but been hitting them 3 x per week lately and they.... Umm.... Responded well haha"
"lol.  Well, those are both very specific strength movements that don't get trained often in the gym for most guys.  Holding on to deadlifts doesn't really do a whole lot for that.  

I do a ton of specialized grip training for, you guessed it, the Marine Corps."
Who the fuck cares what Greg thinks

Fair info. Best of luck for it mate you‚Äôll do well.

"Kinda crazy that even women's physique is becoming a race to the bottom on hyper-conditioned mass monsters though. 

Everyone saying she was robbed is probably baffled that women's is judged the same way as the men's division.

"Getting down to 4% can bring serious health issues with it up to the point of death.
Your brain needs glycose to work and it pulls that from your fat. Youd need to constantly eat sugary stuff and you still wouldnt be able to function normal.

Id say depending on your body type, anything unterneath 20% is great. I personally wouldnt dip below 15% just to avoid any issues"
"Yes, but mainly because I want to eat less when I am sick.  I will still a lot of times at least track protein to make sure it's the minimum."
Savage bruh
Getting OC sprayed is the worst shit to ever happen to me. 10/10 do not recommend boys

Yeah i‚Äôm going to need some science on that.... don‚Äôt spread bro science around these parts bro
"ahh fuckkk, i am so sorry to hear that bro. It's a bitch when you can't trust your knee(s). I dislocated mine 6 years ago and after that dislocated it again a couple of times because of it's more prone to it. Absolutely a bitch to work around but oh well lol 

sucks that you have to be paranoid about both knees wtf
I can't even imagine how crazy i would get after dislocating it on ab crunches haha"
"The supplements aren‚Äôt to blame, you‚Äôre either not eating clean or eating too much, I‚Äôve gained 30lb and maybe 1‚Äù on my waist, because I eat mostly fast digesting meals and have a moderate surplus."
Dayumm! You'll definitely nail it.
Aromatase Inhibitors. People who use steroids may have high estrogen levels due to increased conversion of testosterone into estrogen so they need to take other drugs to reduce the amount of estrogen in the body. High estrogen levels cause to develope feminine traits like man boobs or gynecomastia.
Depression.

"Worked the Think Pink/WV Grand Prix this weekend. Had a really great time and it got me really excited to get to my next prep. Being part of the NPC has given me so many opportunities to surround myself with the best and they‚Äôre all telling me how excited they are for me. Had a good conversation with one of the IFBB judges and he wants to see me at Junior USAs so I need to consider accelerating my timeline. It‚Äôs blowing my mind that I could be starting prep for my pro card run in 10-ish weeks.

And here‚Äôs me getting mogged by Brady King
https://i.imgur.com/JMpeBAh.jpg"
"Holy shit dude I feel you. A family traditional ""recipe"" my dad tought me was taking a feteera (feteer is a type of really buttery bread like thing, a regular sized one has like a thousand cals or something) and spreading powdered sugar, cinnamon and ground nuts all over it and rolling it. Shit had like 2000 calories and I would sometimes have it for breakfast, no wonder i was fat. Now I obviously never have it but I wish I could, Haha. Sorry for going into a rant lol."
"Is okay dude I once only got the memo some girl was interested in me when she called me in the middle of the night telling me she was naked on her bed telling me she needed help . I told her ‚Äú everything okay?  , do I need to call an ambulance ‚Äú"
Yeah I work out at the library too
"U dont see it side by side, i guarantee there would be a large difference side by side. Chris is 6'1. Cedric who is 6'1 weighs around 270 on stage. Cbum would have to gain around 30 to 40 pounds of stage weight"
Any cheaper set of bands off Amazon anyone would recommend?
"yeah thanks!

  One of those on the ground is purely aspirational, lol

  But I do have from 15 - 125 by 10lb increments, and I love them.  Built them out with some York standard plates and some CFF Stainless 38mm handles.  Fortunately had bought most of my stuff pre pandemic, and have actually been able to re-sell chunks of it here and there and re-buy new, upgraded things for basically same cost."
Ok thanks for clearing that up. I scale certain foods for now like oats and meats. I don't have a high enough power level yet to scale all my food yet.
You forget to diet?
"Ngl I‚Äôm pretty content, but romcoms are off limits haha"
"i think ditching the strength work is a big mistake, you should be doing it. you dont bench a plate, your better off getting your numbers higher quicker so the numbers you can use for more volume are greater leading to more long term gains."
You're wrong. You're a psuedocarp.
"yes i understand that, but i'm not looking at only a muscle size POV. my form is definitely very uneven and if i continue with it it will likely cause further and further muscle imbalances and injury. I just wanted to know whether it was correct that tucked vs flared elbows provides more chest activation and therefore less stress on my shoulders and better form."
"It is, it‚Äôs more of a strength routine than anything. It‚Äôs not bad."
Yea easy solution go before work
"Damn babe, looking mad dense. 21y/o 218 is impressive as fuq"
no re**gerts**
"Hey, thanks for the feedback. I have changed it and it should be all sweet and safe now."
Ya Arnie was mad aesthetic. To me tho Shawn Ray is what a bodybuilder should be. He was bigger than the guys form 70s and 80s but have good shape and aesthetics along with conditioning.
Ok thank you!
Why you wanna go and ruin some perfectly good callouses
I'm loving it. Easiest move I've ever made in my life.
Bo has always had a mix of funny with profound introspection and toilet humor. I‚Äôm glad as he‚Äôs gotten older we‚Äôve kind of grown with him and he‚Äôs gotten a lot further in his skill
Stunning
"It‚Äôs pretty tough to really make it in the fitness industry. Sure you can get maybe 10-20k followers if you really try, but to go above and beyond like Christian Guzman is very very tough. Everybody is doing the same thing nowadays which is the problem. Everyone is making videos of them eating and training which is incredibly boring. The guys actually pulling in views like Greg Doucette, Will Tennyson, Mattdoesfitness do fitness content, but they go above and beyond just plain old fitness."
"You look GOOD dude. You‚Äôve got a solid shape and good insertion points.
Definitely keep going. Congrats."
Lol
I don‚Äôt want to rest. I want to be in the gym with metal blasting in my ears and getting fucking intense!
"That's a seperate genetic problem. 

Airplanes are the biggest problem though."
"Man, the news about John Meadows hurts. He was from my hometown and I used to train at the same gym in Highschool before I went to college. I never had the courage to approach him and meet him but I wish I had.

My gym‚Äôs Instagram posted about him and he was a genuine guy. They had pictures of him playing with the gym owners son as if he was his own. I never got to know him but I wish I had. RIP Mountaindog."
What flavor pizza you like best?
"That‚Äôs pretty aggressive unless you‚Äôre trying to get really lean.  My spring cuts are usually around 10-15 lbs and take 3 months.  So I‚Äôll start in March taking it easy, then ramp up in April, and grind out May before maintaining from around Memorial Day to the 4th of July."
For the love of God don't start with tren though
Looking amazing
You're already on the path. Caloric deficit. That is how you lean out. Slowly and steadily breathing out the body fat stores.
So this year is weird because of COVID. Normally you have to place top 2 at a regional show to enter a national show. Due to the huge number of cancelled regional shows most national shows are allowing top 5 this year. So I basically just have to show up to get my NQ and then I can go on to the national level.
"Finally cut down to my goal weight. Now trying to figure out if I want to bulk back up a bit then cut again or go a little farther and get actually lean as fuck before I bulk. I think I‚Äôm still fat by dd standards, so I think I‚Äôm gonna keep cutting til I‚Äôm aesthetic as fuck. Thanks for letting me talk at you guys and figure it out"
Good shoulders and arms for only 15. Keep it up looks like you got structure to put on decent mass
"I'm sure the guy was on some sort of cycle. That doesn't detract from the hard work he put into his body at all though, don't get me wrong"
"Well depends on what division you compete in, you don‚Äôt need to be in the top 1% in terms of drug response to be competitive in classic physique but if you wanted to compete in open sure you‚Äôre rolling the dice"
Great arms.
Oh and also please work out around my fucking camera crew too
Hell yeah brother
They are absolutely huge. Not sure if that's the reason his ankles look ridiculously thin in comparison or it's the perspective of the photo.
The slingshot helps a lot with shoulder pain so it might be worth the investment. What are your numbers on bench? Are you making sure to retract your shoulder blades for the whole lift?
Only on special occasions or when I'm out with the boys. But I try not to drink too much because it's catabolic af and I have a six pack to maintain.
Problems ...
"You're over thinking it bb. If you send like 9 messages in a row then yeah it'll be weird, but 1 a response &amp; another asking her out isn't weird."
Yeah I remember that
"Last week I was really bummed about how sad my delts have gotten. Today I felt better about them and shared a pic on IG. Someone messaged me asking what I did for them and said they were gonna incorporate that :). That felt neat.

Also today I got my first pair of wireless earbuds. Tried them out just working out at home and I ended up dancing in between each set. And I felt cute in my shorts. Today was a good-feels workout :)."
oh okay
"Downvote, shame, and ostracize them so they stop"
The information here is applicable to pretty much any age. Theres young people on this subreddit - but youll find r/Gainit and r/fitness to be a little more welcoming at your age and experience i think. Good luck.
"Wow thanks the the great feedback - miscommunication, I am using insulin needles to pin my AAS everyday, I am not touching insulin itself. 

Okay so my thinking is drop the letro.

Get a better ratio of test : primo, add mast prop 4 weeks out with the tren and then the adrol, I also want to avoid using diuretic - I do thankfully get dry without them. 

It is also my first time I will be running adrol, it‚Äôs my first time doing orals in general actually. 

Would you advice leaving it out or just starting at 3 weeks and seeing how I respond?"
Blessed genetics
I‚Äôve lost my warrior spirit. 3AM bottle feedings for baby have sucked the life force out of me. Low energy training sessions.

"No it's not and it's not supposed to be like gear it's growth hormone pretty much

In turn it would give me better sleep better recovery thus allow me to train harder and gain muscle.

If I'm wrong please correct me.

If I wanted more gear like substance I'd take rad 140 but I wouldn't take it when gear is more efficent anyway."
"So prep was rough bc I was working crazy hours getting a couple of animations out buuut. One of them I did was on the pathology of IgA Nephropathy aka Bergers Disease (apparently Chris Bumstead has this from what my friend said). 

The pharma company called up my boss's boss to tell him how gorgeous it was and how much they loved it... Nice"
Nice try! I‚Äôll give you one anyways
"What‚Äôs the impetus for muscle growth if you do 531 with the 5s Pro instead of the + sets? With the + sets, every week you have the opportunity to make rep PRs and push yourself. But with the 5s Pro, every set should already be more than doable until you get to the third week, and even that should be doable with 5 reps, and without any + sets to really push you. I don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs considered superior to the old version with the + sets?"
The guy sucking his dick.
Oh wow that's actually way better. Stealing.
how much creatine do u guys take? daddy noel said 5g/day but i thought that sounded a bit low?
So sick of seeing average guys complaining about not getting laid while putting 0 effort into actually being attractive. If being above average was easy it wouldn't be above average. And yes looks are not the only factor to attractiveness. I had way more female attention before i started working out and my body image issues consumed my personality

"Man that's super cool , gonna try these in my next session , I used to do it at 45 ¬∞ angle and sure it hits more traps and upper back . My lower lats suck"
"Impressive novice physique. Right now you'll look ok pumped and bronzed.

In 10 weeks I would focus heavily on your calves, they will be the only part of your legs that show under the trunks.

I would also try to visualize what it will look like when you cut, your chest is a bit small/underdefined and your traps could use some bulk as well.

At your age and size these are totally attainable within the 10 weeks, I bet you could get there in 6 or 7 and then really focus on cutting fat."
Run a professional bodybuilding program like Creeping Death 2. Stop writing your own programming.

So true lmao
You want quality food first man. Those come later.
There's a lot of things I really want but can't afford. Doesn't make stealing them OK.
And the really true fans talk about it so much that they know mobile devices often autocorrect the lack of a period.
"Enjoy eating so much, sounds epic!"
Thx

"Lol where do you think governments get their money from to pay for your free shit?  

Regardless of the finances of this particular individual, it's the policy that matters, and the policy is fucking over hundreds of thousands of small business.  Over 160,000 small business closed last year due to lockdowns. 

Just because the place where you personally work wasn't closed, you are here acting all holier than thou.  What if your work closed and you had a family to feed and rent to pay to provide a roof over your house?  Do you think governments can just afford to print money to provide enough food and rent and utilities for people to survive on for years?  

It's already been a full year of this shit.. all for a virus with a 99.X% survival rate. It's utter insanity."

"Bro, that lean body with calves like that are literally the kind of shape that I'm looking forward"
Every cut ends up being a countdown of the days until I convince myself I'm lean enough to go in a surplus again
you probably better off by yourself. I go to gym with my fiance bro and cousin.. All they do is look at there phones and mess up.my momentum

There's diet breaks and refeed days that break up the days."
"Agreed. I don't think by showing a real, bent over, unposed body that has a roll or cellulite that obesity is being glorified."
"Trust me I wrestle and I know to be careful with bug bones and big calves. Only boxing would I have a chance if they are decent.

Or coach )"
"Thank you! 

The event was initially INBA and Natty Revolution sanctioned but then I believe the promoter became involved with the USBF, and so the INBA parted ways. That said, I‚Äôm planning to compete in the USBF events in the future, and also awaiting some more details from the promoter - as they mentioned that a few other leagues were offering pro-cards to Overall Champions after the INBA parted ways.

So we‚Äôll see what else is to come!"
It‚Äôs always the lat pulldown haha.
"Found the best way to do abs guys.

"Thanks for showing us what a natty bodybuilder can achieve, and congratulations!"
Insane lats. What does your back workout look like? GL
thank you! ive been lifting for coming on four years now so its hard to see progress but im gonna keep grinding
On your left side! Your ab inserts pop nice! Do you do much ab workout?
"Yes, I walk 8 miles average every day of the year, some days it may be 6 miles, other days it may be 10-12 miles or more. depends on how i feel. But Yea, I only do full water fasts of 24-48 hours only 2-4 times a year nowadays. Usually my intermittent fast will be something like, 2 scoops whey protein for breakfast with water, then at 6:00-11:00pm I eat dinner and the rest of the days macros. Protein is easy, crockpot a couple pounds of boneless skinless chicken breasts, or tenderloins, and eat with sugarfree ketchup, or drink a pint of fairlife fatfree milk, or have a container of fatfree cottage cheese... yummmmm"
Would definitely have cereal everyday if I was able to control myself with it lmao that's the GOAT postworkout.
üíØ agreed.
"I think it‚Äôs just bots or miserable people hiding behind these Anonymous profiles , but I wouldn‚Äôt lie about that man my health is so important to me I wouldn‚Äôt poison my body this bodybuilding shit is my last priority!"

Jk. There aren't really exact strength requirements for any program. Some programs are better for beginners and some are better for intermediate/advanced lifters, but PPL is good for anyone."
Totally fine so long as its just normal soreness and light fatigue as opposed to something more substantial like the other guy mentioned.
"Yes I do, if I miss a meal I can‚Äôt eat 2 meals worth of calories my next meal"
"Yes, unfortunately this now results in either people being totally suckered into thinking an enhanced look is achievable naturally or it requires 2g of tren - with little middle ground."
"What are they like orthodox Jews? If this is something you feel like needs to ""come out"" to them you can just say they're racist."
"Yea true, but tbh, if you have a genetically blessed structure you can look amazing regardless. I strongly believe that unless you want to be an open or classic bodybuilder, 60% of the genetically relevant component is structure, then it‚Äôs muscle insertion, and then muscle building ability. Most people with even below average genetics can build a lot of muscle with time."
"I'm not dropping calories because I want too, I had to...  literally this is the worst pain I've experienced in my life, like taking a shit with thrombosed hemorrhoids is worse pain then a broken bone, has me literally screaming bloody murder lol.

I've already been lethargic since I dropped the cals, living next too a smoothie king has been a literal life saver so far."
"I think part of it is those jokes typically have some weight to them with other people. They‚Äôre said by people with a significant amount of power over the women they‚Äôre joking about and they usually go along with some allegations that have some substance to them. 

Eddie and his wife have a pretty famously happy marriage and his wife did so much to support him while he was still trying to make it so it definitely comes off as just a joke in poor taste. There are still some power dynamics involved just like any marriage, but it‚Äôs definitely different than if a famous director jokes about raping actresses."
His chest is freaky.
Then up that shit to 1.6g and GROWWWW

"Thanks so much for the advice man. For weight, Ive gone from 58kg to 60kg, but I reckon a lot of that is water and glycogen. Ive been mainly tracking my progress through a few photos, and the strengths of my lifts, but maybe Ill get a measurijg tape so I can check the measurements of my muscles like you said. Should I post a front double Bicep on my account as well?"
I've got this nagging injury behind my left scapula that won't go away because I'm too retarded to take a few weeks off and let things calm down. I usually sleep some way that aggravates it and when I wake up it's hurting pretty badly.
Waist difference is crazy
In all seriousness if a genie offered me the chance to have JP levels of strength but I full on piss myself after each set I‚Äôd take it in a heartbeat
"No, you're talking about Big Ramy."
First 212 champ I believe.
"Used to like Calum till he became a Coke head. Now every time I see him go off on some stupid rant, I know where it's coming from. The dude is gonna blow a hole through his nose before he puts one between his oblong head."
"My favorite version of Ramy ever was with Aceto (2016 Arnold Europe, see video here: [https://www.team-andro.com/tube/v/15809/](https://www.team-andro.com/tube/v/15809/))

And what about Shawn Rhoden and Kamal Elgargni? He's had a lot of great successes. A few failures too, but he's been willing to admit when he made a mistake like with Luke and Cedric. No coach gets it right 100% of the time. Aceto has one of the best and most distinguished track records of any coach."
I think it's the best general purpose program out there.
Ok cool
How many weeks out?  Looking great!

"Boyos I‚Äôm killing my training going into college but honestly he hardest part is the fact that I have to gain another 6 pounds by august and I‚Äôm already kinda uncomfortable being so fluffy. I get that throwing at the college level is a huge opportunity and I‚Äôm obviously not going to chicken out over getting hefty during the coming years but it‚Äôs hard mentally since I‚Äôm usually pretty dang lean. 


I‚Äôm supposed to come into my first year around 220 then be 230-240 in my second year and keep gaining 10-20 pounds a year until I graduate and from there hopefully I‚Äôll be good enough to go pro but it‚Äôs a lot of eating lmao! I‚Äôm already around 4000-4500 calories minimum while trying to only walk around 5k steps. I have no issues getting the food down but it‚Äôs hard to train with that much food in my stomach"
I stole the joke. Broscience has a t shirt that says it
"My fat from this last bulk didnt bother me all that much until I started cutting.

Reddit reminded me I am an obese fatass when I posted pics and I'm now really looking forward to disposing of this fat.

 I am going to be cutting for a loooooong time lmao."
Done this? i will enjoy him attain release...
Hangovers are probably the worst gain killers for me. Nice job on pushing through it.

Now I want a cutout.
"Last night, as I was lying in bed to sleep, I practiced a kind of metta mediation of speaking a few simple mantras to myself such:

"I‚Äôm a 19 year old overweight guy who‚Äôs looking to get into lifting for aesthetic purposes. I‚Äôve been recovering from a lower back lumbar stress fracture for the past year which was caused from playing basketball. Recovery has been slow but I am feeling much better compared to where I was a year ago.

Getting lean and building muscle has been a big goal of mine these past couple years and this injury has delayed that, I‚Äôm still waiting on the all-clear from my physio before I step into the gym though.

I‚Äôm still a complete novice when it comes to lifting and was planning on following this routine:
 https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/ 

I was wondering what some good alternatives were for the deadlift, squats and Romanian deadlift as these these put a lot of strain and pressure on my lower back and would like to avoid them until I‚Äôm completely healed in that area. 

Also, I‚Äôm very worried about doing anything legs-related in fear that I‚Äôll mess up my lower back anymore. Is it ok if I stick to cycling regularly instead of leg-oriented weightlifting exercises at first?

Any tips would be much appreciated, thank you!"

"How can you be this arrogant? What the fuck do you know about someone elses life? As an advanced lifter myself I dont see anything crazy in his physique, he looks sick but it doesnt scream steroids. This type of mindset will get you nowhere"
"Again, I appreciate an actual response. 

I have seen the hype of ‚Äòlifelong damage‚Äô or other similar threats. It hasn‚Äôt been around but about a year so it‚Äôs pretty hard to say it‚Äôs going to leave long term effects. Long term hasn‚Äôt even happened yet.

So I still don‚Äôt see a solution. And what we are arguing about is this video here and this insane authoritarian bullshit that people seem to condone. Currently we don‚Äôt have a solution to it. And lockdowns do very little to help. We have a vaccine and if you wanna take that then go right ahead. 

So then what? Penalize people for trying to live? There‚Äôs a lot of data to suggest the lockdowns have been every bit as deadly as covid. So like I said to the other guy, let people live their lives. If they wanna stay home then go ahead. Keeping everyone locked down to slow trickle the virus through the population doesn‚Äôt fix anything.

So awful, terrible people like me are saying - fuck living in fear. And even more so, fuck allowing the government(s) absolute control over our freedoms. Stop hiding every time the news tells us to, and go out and live your life if you want. 

The people that sit online and try and guilt everyone for ‚Äònot taking this seriously‚Äô are permitting the erosion of everything that makes us human. There are record suicides and calls to suicide hotlines from 2020 as a result of lockdowns, people losing their businesses, domestic disputes and violence, kids not being able to go to school or see their friends, and it goes on and on.

It‚Äôs easy to seem virtuous saying the bumper sticker slogan ‚Äòstay home, stay safe‚Äô and other shit like ‚ÄòI wear masks for the safety of others‚Äô. (There is just as much data to say masks don‚Äôt work as there is data to say they do.) What doesn‚Äôt seem virtuous is mentioning the obvious truth that there will be death and we each have to determine what we want our level of risk to be. The is part of the beauty of actual free countries. This is why all speed limits are not set at 25mph. People that are interested in limiting others‚Äô freedoms for the sake of their own feeling of safety are not to be trusted and should not be given power because they surely will abuse it."

"Lol no, a lot of the men‚Äôs physique pros do not have ‚Äúhuge legs‚Äù, most of them would need to put in some serious work if they ever wanted to switch to classic or BB. There‚Äôs a few guys like Brandon, and I think Caike who have decently developed legs at least to the point where I can respect them for training them decently hard. But make no mistake, it‚Äôs less work and less intense to do physique, and you literally don‚Äôt have to train legs hard..if you think that didn‚Äôt play a role in some of these guys choosing physique then you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Any ‚Äúreal‚Äù respectable BBer I know takes great pride in their leg training and leg development because bar none, training legs truly hard is the most difficult/painful part of training in BBing and you can usually easily tell who busts their ass on leg day and who doesn‚Äôt. 

You also don‚Äôt need to push food as hard or drugs as hard(although I‚Äôm sure a lot of these huge physique guys are probably pushing drugs plenty hard at this point since they look practically like 212 BBers) and I think in general you can get away with having more fun and a lower level discipline in the off season compared to a BBer. What you can get away with is definitely somewhat predicated on your genetics, I mean I know as BBer that if I wanted to do physique it‚Äôs be SIGNIFICANTLY easier, and I could probably get away with a lot of partying in the off season and saying ‚Äúeh I don‚Äôt really want to force feed this meal today‚Äù and still be perfectly fine in terms of my muscularity for physique(I mean, I‚Äôd also have to lose some muscle to begin with but). I‚Äôm not saying these physique dudes at the O don‚Äôt work hard, I know they do, but don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Ä¶a lot of them don‚Äôt have big, well developed legs and it‚Äôd be a significant amount more work if they hypothetically wanted to make the switch to BBing, it‚Äôs just straight up more difficult and requires a different level of work ethic, and discipline, and consistency."

"itll be worth it once u hit it, shit felt better than when i hit 275 lol"
When it starts feeling heavy without one.  It used to be any time over 2 plates.  Now I'm stronger and the belt goes on at about 4.  Or if it's going to be a high rep set e.g. 335x5 won't get a belt but 335x10 will.  Wrist wraps start going on at about 20 lbs after the belt.
"Literally started 3 weeks ago, injured wrist 5 days ago. Muscle was fine but forearm still impossible to use well rn. Was like 7 centimeters long split like w vagina.

"What was your diet like, how calories anf macros"
"yeah uhh you sound like you dont understand homeostasis and some finer aspects of human metabolism/physiology. thats fine, but realize whatever you take in is hopefully what your body needs. building muscle doesn't take just protein (it can because protein can be used for fuel or broken down and the energy from stored in fat). but it's easier to provide building blocks and fuel. if you're fat then likely you're ok to drop calories. 2000 drop is excessive given a normal person should be eating about this much daily. so unless you normally eat 6000 calories then no I would not drop 2000 like that. you'lll feel like ass and it'll make working out harder. when ppl cut they don't make the deficit so large otherwise they will lose muscle as well."

Wednesday: Deads and OHP

Friday: Squats &amp; bench

Monday: Deads and OHP

I've been doing Monday Tuesday, Friday Saturday a lot and I enjoy these pairs the most but for the next few months i gotta cut down to 3 days. Do i need to swap to a more dedicated 3 day program or will this allow me to still progress as i should?"

"Was stuck at a 495 DL for months and last week just randomly went to 515 on a whim, and got it easily...was so confident that I went for 525 and it also went right up with just a minor amount of hitching the last 10% of the way.

It wasn't even like I started bulking or something; if anything, I was eating a bit less than usual that week.

Sometimes it just be that way, I guess."
"I am not trying to be a dick, but I'll be a dick. 145 lbs... so 66-7 kg at 179 cm is underweight lmao

"Bulking shouldn‚Äôt be an excuse to get fat, too many guys seem to make this mistake and then have to do a long harsh cut where they lose much of what they gained in the bulk. Yeah during a bulk you‚Äôll add a bit of body fat but if you got ‚Äúfat‚Äù during a bulk you screwed up IMO."

If anything I‚Äôm super pleased with how good I look at a low weight. Forever I was worried that going below 240 would make me look small. All that‚Äôs happened is that I look even more badass, and I have to eat less lmao"
"Wrong sub homie, try r/steroids"
"Was going to say the same. OP looks great and his transitions are really nice and smooth, but the fact that no pose is held longer than half a second kind of ruins it for me. As important and often overlooked as the transitions are, it's still called posing and you should really hold a pose for at least a couple of seconds. As it is, it reminds me of Jason Genova, the fastest poser in the west."
I avoided dumbbell rows for so long because the first year or so I started lifting my MMC sucked ass with them. but now that I know how to properly contract muscles all I want to do is db row on pull days
"Can only use gamma bomb as an example since its the only program of his I ran and im not gonna parrot.

But do 3 sets of 8 at the top weight. I think the 65/75x8 was a typo"

"Solid advice thank you very much. I‚Äôve never had anything against machines but always saw it as critical to use free weights.

Your reasoning is obviously sound, I guess I just have to get out of my own head with traditional lifts. Obviously nothing with with traditional lifts but I can see brining in other things to switch up training and allowing for different stimulus. 

Thanks!!"

"Well I lied in a previous comment‚Ä¶I have a little more energy to give to this just because you‚Äôre a prick.

I want to point out to a certain individual that a 5 minute google search on women caring about height yielded some interesting results. It seems that based on what I read in a few studies/articles, 48-55% of women prefer to date taller men. So that leaves you with 45-52% of women who don‚Äôt care about it as much as you think. So the common denominator here is YOU bud. Stop blaming everything else for your problems and get some help. Or if you want to keep living your life that way, by all means go right ahead."
I also have super long bicep insertions. Some people shit on me for it and some people think it makes my biceps look massive. A blessing and a curse for sure.
"Am I the only one that really dislikes the beach?

I was considering just running an Arnold split 5 days a week without the second arm/shoulder day."

Monday, overhead barbell press 5X5 (adding weight each set, mainly interested in lifting more weight here), barbell curls, 2 warm up sets of 10 then 2 hard work sets of 8-10. Skull crushers (same sets and reps as curls). Finish with barbell wrist curls and reverse wrist curls 2 hard sets of 15-20 each.

Tuesday is just barbell Rows and squats, 5X5 same as overhead presses.

Wednesday off

Thursday, same as Monday except I do standing tricep extensions instead of skull crushers.

Friday, same as Tuesday.

Saturday and Sunday off."
"i‚Äôd do whatever basic shit for a week or 2 then tell him have fun and do your own thing. both lift at the same time, work in if you‚Äôre doing the same thing/spot for each other, but otherwise run your own shit. doesn‚Äôt work super well otherwise imo"

"Thanks for the tip on weighted external rotation. I don't find a problem with it during lifts at all, but recently it's started feeling extra loose, like it's.... slipping? Just throughout the day. I did shoulders yesterday and it felt completely fine though.

I always have to sort of shrug/roll/pop my shoulder back into place it feels like. Do you do the same?

Did you get it professionally looked at?"
Nice. Rack pulls helped my DL explode when I plateaued. Just do them dead stop and your lower back and spinal erectors will get much stronger.
"Does it really matter?   I mean, ok... I get it but this is why I asked about meds and doses.  Dude is pushing 60.  TRT that takes him to a test around 500 (late 30s / early 40s) is, in my mind, kinda still natty.  TRT taking him to 1200?  Yeah, that's just juiced.    


I guess I kind of look at it like most sports leagues.  TRT is fine if it is keeping you within normal levels.  TRT that takes you over the top?  Not cool."
"&gt;I worry mainly about my genetics

Worst thing you can do, ""worry"" about you can control, and worry shouldn't really be the word, more like act upon what you need.

At this point your issue was that you went too far with your bulk, so you went on a cut, it's being successful for what can be seen. You're on track to improve what you have to improve, nothing to worry about mate."

Do your counterfit steroids make you delusional also??"
"Haha that last sentence is where I‚Äôm worried.

Yeah to be honest I can admit I generalized the entire genre(?) based off that weird shit. Fucking hentai and weird ass shows and such, or dudes Naruto running IRL lmao.

But I‚Äôm definitely more keen to it now. I‚Äôve even convinced my girlfriend they‚Äôre not that weird (though no shot she watches any of it).

Amazing job!!! That‚Äôs a great accomplishment! My only advice is to work on holding the poses a bit longer. Really give the judges time to admire what you‚Äôve built.
"Hey man I really appreciate all this. At the moment I train each muscle group three times a week. I do a 6 day cycle, doing back and shoulders mon, wed, fr; then chest and arms tues, thurs, sun. 

I‚Äôve never really found fatigue to be an issue, no matter how hard I workout, I don‚Äôt feel it the next day. It‚Äôs probably helped by the fact that I‚Äôm 18, eat at least 150g of protein day and get 8hrs of sleep a night. The reason I don‚Äôt train legs at the minute is that I work in physically intense job, and I only really fatigue from leg exercises, and I don‚Äôt want it to affect my job performance. 

With regard to the shoulders being a limiting factor in training chest due to fatigue, it wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd experienced but more of a hypothesis. But your comment about retracting the scapular was certainly very helpful. 

But the program I use at the moment is definitely one of my own creation, and it has changed massively and will continue to do so as I try to do what best fits my needs. 

Funnily enough I had a hunch about the training things first to help their development. 

Thank you for all your advice, I really appreciate, if you‚Äôve got any more, especially about my split, I am more than happy to hear it. I always appreciate any solid advice I can get"
Man still looks like he‚Äôs killed a few people. Lmao

"Barbell, guy was accusing competitors of using too much when they were on a gram per week, and then complimenting a girl for curling more than he did when she had a 60lb bar in her hands in a different thread."
"Definitely subbing out. I believe muscles benefit the most when hit from all angles, and ranges of motion. With that being said, you could also alter some other things like the speed of the rep. I found that once i stalled on my bench press i incorporated a couple of sets of lower weights but really slow, squeezing reps and it made my regular bench improve as well. Guess it hit some other muscle fibers and fixed some of the weaknesses i had, which in turn boosted my overall force output."
"Thank God my job has a gym we can freely use. 

This is all feeling similar to how it was before they started shutting shit down again. Power hungry fucks."
"Gf says I ruined her taste in men bc she used to like stick figure guys but now she's only attracted to muscle.

Am I making it?"
Crazy man. You even look younger now!‚Äô
"Aah okay. Never thought about that. As i said in the beginning ‚Äûdont get me wrong‚Äú. I was really interested in that without any negativity. Im more the introvert guy training in big hoody and dont want to show myself because i simply dont feel like im ready or even close to my goal. 

I wish you all the best. Stay confident"
"Yeah, I mean the amount of PEDs he would need to be a successful boxer is exponentially less compared to WSM. Probably nothing detrimental to his health."
"Yeah i like preacher curls and cable curls but thats pretty much it, but im mainly doing wide grip ez bar curls because the outside of my bis (i think its called the long head?) Is much more unimpressive than the inside (which is still unimpressive) probably because i stuck to preachers and cable curls for too long."

"Ofcourse there is a reason to hate him..He keeps giving hints to his fans that he will compete, but just posts an Advert for his e-Books in the end. This leads to people getting annoyed and just hates him"

Saw him at the Cali pro 2017 when he lost to Gerald Williams who was in the best shape of his life. Sas Was only behind one point in pre judging could have gone either way. The next year he took second again to deasha. Hope he comes back
Hell ya bro! Most of the time it‚Äôs convincing my clients to perfect their nutrition and training before we push the gear to higher levels. You‚Äôd be surprised what 500mg test and 25mg dbol will do with razor sharp nutrition
No problem man.
Rofl not once have you ever posted 245. You post all your weights and you say 230 in 2020. You out here trying to throw numbers for what? Reddit clout? You weren‚Äôt 245 for your cut.
Yes fine whatever
"Yeah I don‚Äôt follow Larry‚Äôs content too closely, but IIRC Andrew was just a random dude working out at the gym when Larry met him. It makes me wonder how many 1 in 10,000,000 genetic marvels are out there living regular lives with no idea of their physical potential. Like the greatest NBA player of all time is probably a South Sudanese farmer who has only ever tried soccer or some shit like that. The greatest powerlifter of all time could be a garbage man in Finland who drinks 6 nights a week and works out once a month, so he‚Äôll never know his potential.

We talk about some of the most genetically gifted bodybuilders of all time like Ronnie, Kevin Levrone, and Phil Heath... but what if they‚Äôre only actually like 1 in 100,000? Such a tiny percentage of the total population ends up actually putting quality years into building their physique, so more gifted athletes would never know."
Lots of people don‚Äôt realize that loose skin looks a whole lot better on most people if they put on muscle and get leaner.

"Um, who says you won't cheat on a world class program? When you're single digit bodyfat and literally feeling starvation 24/7, you have pretty serious temptation to cheat. It's not uncommon at all for these guys to have a ""handler"" during the last weeks/days of a prep for this exact reason."
Has the boost worked for you?

Agreed with the other mate this isn't bodybuilding it's an anorexic look. You need more muscle
"Ya people need to cool down on these things until people are truly side by side. Jones is moving to open and Timms barely made top 10. Ramon is good and all, but he had 4 people who were very much ahead of him."
That's awesome dude!  I hope you get it!  Yeah the craziest was like.  2 of the people that were there a long time were husband and wife. So they got like 40k together.

Friend of mine had one and it just up and had a heart attack at like 6, which considering they usually only live to about 8 or so anyway, isn't that bad. Until you remember how much you can expect to pay for one..."
The god lighting in my bedroom has given me this weird reverse body dysmorphia where I think that I look way better than I do in reality.  I suppose it‚Äôs better than the opposite though.

Appreciate the honesty.
Looks good
I am also very happy for seeing this
"Nope. Your body has no way of burning calories to cool you down. We can burn calories to heat ourselves up, but our only cooling mechanism is to sweat and hope the evaporation cools us. And sweating is just excretion of liquid, that doesn‚Äôt burn calories"

"I had good results lifting 3 times per week with Building The Monolith.

"It may just be me. But I feel like JM built the program the way he did for a specific reason. If someone can‚Äôt push themselves without doing the same exact routine every single week, it seems like they just aren‚Äôt advanced enough to fully understand their body, yet."
"I mean, youd have to shit out solid unprocessed food, ans thatd be a different issue entirely"
Holy fuck you look like an avenger or something. Insane taper and your delts need their own area code
"Yes I take some and yes, some of them work. Most of the ones that have a name like that are just a mix of supplements that have varying levels of efficacy. You could probably buy them all separately for way less money but there is convenience in taking 1-3 pills vs 10. Examples of supplements that work are berberine, TUDCA, NAC, and astragalus."
Dude has an insane taper if you flip the third picture upside-down.

noobie and probably dumb question: did he train his neck (if possible?) or he's just built like that?
Dude stop trying to sell Mike Israetel\`s shit in this sub. Yes he\`s ight but there is not a single pro bodybuilder who uses his techniques. This is a bodybuilding sub. Under every single thread you try to explain his shit.

Yeah. They locked r/smallcockfitbody too
I'm kind of confused. Is my chest underdeveloped or am I just fat? Or both?
Flawless
"With all due respect man, you‚Äôre young and your muscle doesn‚Äôt look super mature. It‚Äôs hard to tell when there‚Äôs little separation and the shape of the muscle will also be determined by lifting form and your training route. That being said you look young and there‚Äôs already some development there so your cap is probably pretty high at the moment. I‚Äôd say start lifting and develop the muscle for a few months, get some experience and then check back in. If you workout, you‚Äôre going to look significantly better physically, regardless of the genetics"
"This is by far the best fuckin comment I've ever seen on all of reddit.

"Ok, I'll try upping my sodium intake and see what happens. Thank you very much for taking the time to help me out.

Yeah, when this first started happening I went to the GI of foods and started paring down foods that were high. I do have bananas with oatmeal for breakfast for potassium. I'll think about adding some more sources throughout the day."
Would bury my face in that ass.
"Yup! People like to regurgitate the same old bs when the truth is that the showings at 1980 were sub-par. Mike looks great in some pics but if you see video it's very clear that he had trouble holding poses, holding in his stomach and his chest was very weak, along with his legs. 

Everybody got salty that Arnold could beat with barely any prep. Arguably, if Zane hadn't gotten injured, he could've beaten Arnold but Zane looked almost natty during the competition."

Hi prep buddy! Let‚Äôs suffer together!
oh ok
It‚Äôs okay. What I always find works for me when I‚Äôm struggling is to do something with people that occupies the mind. Can lead to some great experiences.
"Yeah, but like... I can do that with just one single 2-ply square unfolded is what I'm saying"
You pice of shit
This guys home page reads like a 4th grader wrote it.
As someone who love DOMS I‚Äôm mad jelly

What kills me is looking up the definitions of both inflammable and flammable. Or the genius that put the letter B in the word subtle.
"He was natural here too. Goes to show how genetics are the single most important aspect of a bodybuilder's success.

Now can we imagine what the guys like O'Hearn, Simeon Panda, and Ulysses would look like if they ever got on even just 150mg test??? Absolutely crazy."
Yeah that makes sense.
"So weird his arms look massive in some poses them he brings them up and they look so small , he‚Äôs in great condition but still has a long way to go for a balanced physique"
"No lmao nothing wrong with the bench or rack as far as I can tell. 

I feel like I‚Äôm retracting my scapula, and I have my feet in that weird position because that helps me feel the tightest. I actually just tried doing it with feet more flat, and my left glute started cramping up like crazy, and I felt My arch collapse more when the bar got close to my chest (I have an inverted sternum so I need a big arch to feel like the bar can come down just far enough to be comfortable, otherwise it just feels bad)"

This is why I'm following up with those questions on people's comments...mostly for my own curiosity."
"Bought a V8 today :) very excited bois

Your body is under stress so cortisol rises. One of cortisols functions is waking you up. Your body is basically saying ‚Äúget the fuck up and go hunt‚Äù.

Arnold said his calves were a weak point. Show me one picture where Arnold‚Äôs calves look ‚Äútiny‚Äù compared to the rest of his physique
"Ur right, this one was worse. (I listened to the whole thing though lol)"
"clearly 5.385%, give or take .001"

I‚Äôd recommend messing around with with elbow placement till it feels comfortable
"Eat at a slight surplus to gain 1-2 lbs per month, you **have** to put on weight in order to gain muscle.

If you're worried then cut down first before bulking."
"It's definitely not a concern of them being upset with the noise considering it's currently winter and people aren't outside much.  It's more of an insecurity thing.  I have an irrational dislike of being ""judged"" by people.  I don't wanna be known as the Busch-league drumming dude of the neighborhood."
You mean the way he did. I miss that guy.
Sodium isn‚Äôt inherently bad. Consistency with it is what matter most.
"Still got back pain from 4 days ago fro the when I did back

Right under shoulder blade

I tried icing it and it made the pain worse for now maybe it will calm down once the skin is to higher temperature.

Toomorow is technically back day should I still try? Or continue resting.


I don't have any pain when doing any form of rowing or pull upp motion but there's this constant throbbing pain right there and sometimes I can kinda feel it like spasm like very subtle like there's this specic part that tenses up. But it's not like a full on muscle cramp.

Anyone had this and how did you solve it if you did?"
"I also take dex.5 EOD to control my insane estrogen. But acne isn‚Äôt necessarily the result of high estrogen in itself, the cause is usually related to fluctuations with your androgens. What steps are you taking to ensure you have a stable blood serum concentration? What is your administration frequency?"
"&gt; I've heard good things about tbol and var together.

the ol broderick special lmao. the reasoning behind it is because each one boosts different systems (im totally blanking on them, i swear one was glycotic and forget the other) so you get a 1+1=3 effect. var typically makes you super strong but doesnt bring tons of glycogen effects, tbol makes you feel like an athlete, good amount of glycogen but not excessive and gives you stamina. strength + stamina = greatness. however, this big effect of 1+1=3 is seen in women, in men its more like 1+1=2.2ish. why? no idea, theory would be something about men having more muscle already and something about glycogen stores being fuller already (?) so you dont see tons out of the combo. 

as for your hair stack, all i can say is good luck. you have an incurable genetic trait and drugs arent going to help with that but your best bet is test only + non DHT orals + your hair loss stack."
Def got the frame keep that waste tight and grow tree trunks and ull be on point

Lets say i want to gain muscle and i eat at 300 surplus but habe Like 15% bodyfat , do i still need the 300, surplus or will my Body get the calories it needs to build muscle if i dont eat in a surplus exactly from the fat so basically recomp?"
You look like a 15yo in a Netflix show

"Yeh man it‚Äôs crazy. I look now like the person I always wanted to look like. Every time I reach a goal, I reach an equal negative psychological defect. 

I mean I‚Äôm being a little dramatic yeah, but I know I have to get a grip on this stuff. I don‚Äôt want to be using gear in my 50s. At least not the way I‚Äôm using it now."
"That‚Äôs odd. Especially since you have been using it for a while. The itchy/crawly is obviously normal but hives, not so much. I‚Äôd just keep an eye on things. Maybe switch pre workouts if it gets worse or begins to bug you. Other than that, happy lifting!"
Unpopular opinion. I like doing leg day in pants so I can feel the pump tightening up my pants as the workout goes on
"Just stick with it, dude. Same shit happened to me, mental health issues didn't help and I ended up a full blown alcoholic for a couple year and that absolutely destroyed parts of me life.
Gave up completely in April 2016 and it was probably one of the single best things I ever did, don't regret it for a second.
All its gonna do otherwise is send you so far backwards, ruin your health, and ruin your life. As I'm sure you're aware.
You'll pull through, dude. Just one foot after another and forgot anything else"
Your symmetry is awesome and those shoulders are sculpted. Im jelly
"Tbh your progress is really good, seems like you added a nice amount of muscle without adding much fat! 

You're not chubby at all but completely understand the struggle. You could go on a cut now but I don't think that'll do unless you work in your self image a bit first, since once you're a couple of months in the cut you will probably start thinking you're too small and think about stopping and bulking again.

Again, really good job dude. Whatever you do, make sure to keep enjoying the process, that's the best of the sport!"
He is excellent. Very thoughtful and detailed
Thanks Mr Meadows

You think he was actually being honest about how much he took? Or was he lying because he didn‚Äôt want to admit his actual dosages because he didn‚Äôt want people to think he was a juice head? It‚Äôs impossible to get to IFBB pro size without abusing ridiculous amounts not only gear but insulin and HGH. Remember what Pete Rubish said in a video several years back about the current status of gear in the lifting world? He doesn‚Äôt even bother to ask powerlifters and bodybuilders what they take because he knows they‚Äôll lie about how much they take.
Based on the title alone I was coming here to say no one tops Mike Matarazzo and then I opened and could not believe the size and development of Fankhouser‚Äôs.  You are correct internet stranger.

"I'm with you like 99% of the way here. That 1% disagreement comes from you saying legit var isn't common. While that was true as recent as just a couple of years ago, it's certainly not the case now.

There are multiple VERY popular review boards for UGL suppliers, anyone faking anything gets immediately ousted and ostracized from the community. As long as you so much as do 5 minutes of research, there's no reason to get bunk/fake gear.

Also, side note to OP, there are plenty of TRT clinics that will prescribe var to you with your test, might be the route to go if you've got the extra money and are still worried about legitimacy."
Looked easy for ya
Jon Bones Jones would definitely know that to be the case

"Will getting more sleep with better gains? I been lifting for 4 months now(see profile for pics), is having only hours of sleep affecting my gains?"

"Well, i has a problem with my chest, i never felt them while working out. 
It's related on genetic and muscle insertion...

It could be related to some workout background, i use to do lots of push up and dips didn't do them the right way to focus on chest (lack of knowledge) so anytime the triceps and shoulders gets all the benefits


I always get pumps on the triceps and shoulders, even the traps while doing bench press (dumbbells or barbells)
I kept working them, and tried to isolate them in anyway possible 

After 4 years of gym, i got a legit and proportionate chest size, i can feel the pump in them while benching barbells.

Unless you use some chemical, the process is slow, the natural way.... but if you keep working on them long enough you will always get a better results"
"God. 

I love reading about the old strongmen, their lifestyles, diet, training etc. 

They did a lot of things right, nearly all of them were unbelievably active, something like doing hard labor, then off to the gym lifting weights and then swimming 4km in the lake after work to relax. 

Amazing time for strongmen."
Depress your front shoulder. Don't flex the more forward pec.
"Wow, you are in luck.  Today's daily thread is ""Training Thursdays"" and that would be a perfect place for that.  As others have said, here in the DD works too."
Great hot take mate.
"Okay so what I will say here is that a competition prep is cut, but a cut is not competition prep. What I mean is that a competition prep goes beyond the normal level of what most would cut down to. Generally speaking, most people cut down to 8-11% body fat (for men) or when they can see abs, things like that. When someone is prepping for a bodybuilding show, you are typically driving body fat closer to 4-5% (for men again) and it gets exponentially more difficult to lose fat the lower you go. There is going to be a certain level of mental and physical exhaustion that is reached that you don't normally see. He's going to be tired, he's going to be doing a lot of cardio, and eating a lot less. He might get quieter than usual, his sex drive is going to decrease whether or not he's taking any drugs, and overall will just have less energy. It's NOT personal so don't take it that way. If you have an event or something and he doesn't have the energy to go, don't force him or make him feel like he has to if he doesn't have the energy, especially when he's getting to 6 weeks out from a show. Most of the time on prep, I just want to go to the gym and chill. My social life gets limited.

So I say that just to give you some idea of what to expect and if you want to be the best for him during it, just be secure in the fact that he might not be able to do normal boyfriend stuff and the best way to support him is just to simply be understanding and patient with it.

u/brazenmaiden, anything you want to add I may have not thought about?"
"thanks! I appreciate it, though the unneeded hostility I didn't :)"
He‚Äôs saying you have huge legs

Try hiring a coach to help you with macros. Sometimes the macros make all the difference even if you‚Äôre in a deficient and eating too little protein your body won‚Äôt respond the same
"Got the Axe and Sledge Smores protein in yesterday, pretty good. Can't wait to try out the bars, went with the obvious...peanut butter chocolate chip."
That‚Äôs a great song but I‚Äôve gotten myself to the point where I need heavier music to get hyped :(

Lol stay mad. I‚Äôll stay winning. Regardless I‚Äôm sure I look better than you. :). Thanks for your comments tho
I don't think you get to complain about the sub going to crap while posting stuff like this.

"**Shaker Bottle Rectal Durability**

I like to test the durability of my shaker bottles by shoving them straight up my ass and then clenching as hard as possible to see if I can shatter it using my sphincter. 

So far I am undefeated, please let me know when you've concluded your research."
"Seriously, who wants bland and unseasoned food lol"
"Long answer is coming. But you can gain muscle in a deficit under the right conditions, especially as a beginner. Muscle gain and fat loss are separate processes, although being is a surplus is a more advantageous environment for muscle growth. As a beginner, your body will be hyper-resbonsive to training because you‚Äôve never done it before (or not a lot of it) so it won‚Äôt need a caloric surplus to grow, particularly if your bodyfat percentage is higher. 

As far as programming goes, it‚Äôs up to you. You will benefit from having a higher frequency, because you don‚Äôt take as long to recover, and a smaller pool of exercises, because you‚Äôre still learning how to do them. If you want to do more than just 5x5, then that‚Äôs a good thing imo and I say have at it. Those type of programs, imo, aren‚Äôt tailored to the physical limitations of beginners, but the intellectual limitations. 5 exercises, 5 reps, add 5 lbs per workout, all you have to remember is the number 5, which is about as much thought as some people are willing to put into it. Based on the type of questions you‚Äôre asking, this does not apply to you. If you are willing to put in more work than that, you can benefit from it, but I‚Äôd still stick with full-body or upper/lower, and something that is focused on the core movements; squat, bench, deadlift, shoulder press, barbell rows.

On another note, there isn‚Äôt much of an actual dichotomy between strength and size. They are directly related because a bigger muscle is a stronger muscle. *Specificity*, as in, how well you apply that strength to a particular task through perfecting your technique with that task, but the underlying  strength is based mostly on how much muscle you have, so any program that is effective in one, needs to have a focus on both things. The best program imo is the one you will stick with because you enjoy it, and that will motivate you to put in your best effort. Effort is the number one most important thing."
"Whenever I doubt myself, I return to the ""are you doing whatever it takes"" video"
You look amazing for just training 14 weeks. I assume you‚Äôve already been an athlete and have a great foundation.
Yeah. There‚Äôs mirrors in the bathroom.

"Well then where the hell are the bottom-heavy juicy-booty girls supposed to compete then? All kidding aside, I wasn't really thinking that you'd likely need to lose your natty card to properly do well in Wellness, I can see why that'd be a roadblock for you."

buying BBQ sauce has been one of the best investments I have made so far during this cut. Made the worst meals taste like a treat

Kai looks fantastic.

I have a friend opening one of those. I really want to try it.
Wrong sub...
"Take an NSAID like ibuprofen not Tylenol. Alternate heat and cold, massage the area (gun or just hand) while slowing straightening the arm out. Also taking an EAA will help with recovery but ‚Äútime-off‚Äù DOMS like this is kind of inevitable."

It‚Äôs so fun
The only comment you should pay attention to. ^^^^^
Is the tony huge protoje called bodybuilder in Thailand?
"Poor op. Hes just trying to teach us that chest flyes are good too, or something."
"I don't know what your workouts look like but  I will say this: once I started lowering the weight (10-15 reps) on exercises like lat pulldown and cable rows and focusing on contracting my lats, they started to grow.  During a back workout you imo you should be feeling your lats getting a huge pump or else you are using too much of other muscles involved in pulling.

This took years of trial and error. Once I was able to really feel the contraction with lower weights, I started to play with heavier weights (8-15 reps)."
It was also pathetic that the officials at the Mr. Olympia didn't have anything to say about George Peterson's death that occurred hours before the show.
Sucks. But it's a learning lesson. People have to look at exercise selection as Risk vs Reward.
Oh man I just read the article on his arrest. 3 years! That's brutal. I thought the UK was pretty lax on AAS stuff. He must have pissed someone off.
If you need to consistently mini cut you‚Äôre bulking wrong.
"Meh. I like to listen to podcasts when I‚Äôm driving. When I‚Äôm lifting, I don‚Äôt like to split my attention between that and listening to a podcast. I prefer music (usually some instrumental metal) to get me in the zone."

"One of my friends got diagnosed with ADHD during college and it was an insane difference. He went from failing school, playing videogames 40hrs a week, and being hella depressed to getting As, doing work ahead of time, and not being depressed. Now he's in grad school.

Okay thanks. I actually have another question if you don‚Äôt mind answering
He turned into a pseudo nut job just like everyone else from 2013. He‚Äôs active on Instagram and does a lot of yoga/mobility stuff
"Wow, Brian shaw posted something similar, and just look at all the influencers supporting this sentiment on callums post. I'm an American so i'll be speaking about my country.

Its sad, and its simply a non argument. Lets go with their line of thinking here. Wearing a mask is infringing on your freedom. I can't go outside naked without getting arrested, so does that mean I dont have a freedom? I might not have literal freedom to do absolutely anything I want, but we live in a society, we pay taxes, we have laws, have a police force. Because when you live in a society and reap the benefits of it, there are rules in place to keep order, to make sure that people don't infringe on others.

It was the same principal during WWII, America was low on supplies in the middle of a war, so people had to make sacrifices including rationing food and gas. This is no different. Its just absolutely disappointing to see how many around the country and the world think a mask/vaccine infringes on your freedom. 

Again, when you live in a society, there are rules. If you want to be truly free, go live in a rainforest somewhere. But arguing that your freedom as an American citizen is being taken away, and thinking your some patriot? Let me remind you that kids younger than you were drafted and had no ""freedom"" but to give their life for this country, your actions are the definition of irony."
Surprisingly my mom let it go. She‚Äôs fine with it after I explained and sent her the studies
"I was super into body building when I was a teenager, got to be about 5‚Äô10 180 lbs with 12ish% body fat at 16/17. Then college/life got in the way, and started drinking beer. 

Now I want to get back into it, but weigh about 205 and have lifted in a few years. 

What would you all recommend for the approach here? Cut weight down to 170 lbs then bulk? Try to gain mass while losing weight (which doesn‚Äôt work great).

Curious what you all think."
"Alright boys, brutally honest. Not really feeling this greta album. The thing I love about music is finding unique sounds and bands crafting their own voice. And this just sounds like a led zeppelin tribute band. Like yeah they're definitely talented but theyre just following a formula from 50 years ago"
Conditioning was really good imo
"Forget these people man. If lifting and competing makes you happy and you can stay healthy, keep it up. Looking forward to seeing what you look like in 12 weeks!"
"Obviously listening to podcasts is a poor ""credential"" but is what he's saying actually wrong?

Normal testosterone production is affected by day to day life, it's affected by the amount of sleep you get, it's affected by your diet, it's affected by certain medications etc and it's rarely at a constant rate.

From what I understand, with frequent pinning your testosterone levels are fairly consistent and those levels aren't affected by factors like your diet, sleep quality etc. Even if your testosterone levels remain in range I'd have thought you'd have an advantage when it comes to strength and size on TRT compared with natural production."
True lol.  I guess it's just surprising to me with two Covid lockdowns.  It would be the first time where I know I lost some muscle and might expect to see those numbers increase.  But I have been a serious lifter for four years now so newbie gains aren't as easy.
Lol

awesome man thanks for the tips!
"You are like the natty version of this other chick who keeps showing up on here.

Great work."
Wuuttt...   thats like the last thing they do before entering the competition?  ü§î  they dehidrate and when they are at the competition they take a shot of nice quickly carbs?  To pumb up  ü§î
Congratulations on patting yourself on your back for your genetics which you have absolutely no control over.  What you can control is working out.  It is normal to look like that at 14.  If you want to start lifting just start lifting.
Wtf
"Agreed. I can‚Äôt imagine the toll on his body that must have been though, to keep peaking like that for every show"
"This is gorgeous, like something I wish I could replicate. How do u come up with the transitioning and how it flows? I would assume ur one of those to have that natural flow so it comes without practice"
It's just weird for those of us who aren't fourteen year olds to be sitting here looking at a thread about mocking some fourteen year old who's just trying to be fit. 'Weird' is putting it lightly.
Why is this in a bodybuilding sub. Who cares- he‚Äôs still handsome.

I mean that's better than drinking at a big party during covid imo
Oberst has been anti vax and mask since the start. And encouraging people to.party 4th of July when this shit first started. Lost all respect for him then

Why are you training to failure? Follow a program.

"Conditioning matters, yes. So does every other aspect. Nick makes it look like its the only thing that does. You don't have to be a BB nerd to get the sport my dude, just watch less mainstream channels. It's a subjective sport, true.

good shape
"I'm 23, but feel like an old man because of tendinitis in my right knee. Probably attributed to my knee pain as I've been doing a lot more walking at work(stairs and ladders included) and upping my cardio the last couple of months. Went a little too deep in high bar squats 2 weeks ago and been weird since. The trap strain was from high volume barbell shrugs which I should have known was a bad idea after heavy RDLs yesterday. Live and learn."
Yes sorry
He's looking good. How would you actually develop a physique like this? I wonder what his training looks like?
"Not at all my friend, I appreciate the constructive criticism"
"Yes, today"
"Keep working! I can clearly see you're in better shape than pretty much every 15 years old I knew when I was your age, but this is nothing crazy. You got a wide back for your age, but no definition to it which is perfectly normal. Just rest enough, eat right and enough and keep training hard ! The rest will come with time, your super young! Not much else to say really, get back to us in a few months :)"
Muscle confusion!

Yeah man. I just turned 47 this month. 3rd place 212 is 50 yo. You limit yourself. Hopefully you lived a good life and can back on that.

"And that's what you want to avoid! lol Something I've had to learn is to not rant. (I'm 38 and literally ""Rant"" was my go-to form of communication for most of my life. And it makes sense--the favorite topic of each person is themselves and their interests. That doesn't make them bad people or narcissists, just normal. People like the sound of their own name and love to talk about the things that interest them. Hence your (and my) proclivity to rant about diet, hobbies, etc. An easy way to turn the conversation from Pec-Major teaches anatomy to a normal interaction is to ask them a question in return:

* Yeah, what are some of your goals?
* Have you ever been on a training schedule? 
* What's your fitness background, if any?

Stuff like that will get them eating out of your hand, and you'll be able to go from rant to conversation. Don't underestimate the magic of the word ""you"""

No of course not. Ramy has him beaten in so many ways it isn't even funny. I don't think he has a shot at winning the Arnold either tbh.
Looks pretty AND delicious. I love lentil pasta
You are a man of class and are in fact better than others
"No worries man lol, hope the rest of your week is awesome too!"
I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt know anything about body building and what is the last one with all due respect you aren‚Äôt the most buff in the last picture sorry if this comes across as rude
Can you share your magical internet program? I'm trying to downsize and not make progress
"well yeah, both tits obviously"
"Damn your body looks amazing OP. Your highlights are quads, back, biceps and triceps. Your hamstrings also look good in that side pose. Keep it up!"

Yah if u get a 5 gallon bucket fill that bad boy with rice and Ed or eod you stick your arms in there and make closed fist and then open fist then closed etc until you can‚Äôt anymore  your forearms will burn ! It‚Äôs a old baseball trick pitchers use. The deep you are in the bucket the harder it will be to make a closed fist https://youtu.be/Lzrib1c5EK0
Waiter curls are pretty good for not using the forearms.

Manly of us have been there sadly. Life changes quite a bit when you work on yourself and get confident doesn't it?
"Lmfao come on man, time and place."
Arnold's lighting here is way better tbf
Not a soul on the Olympia stage is natural. Not a one. Men or women.
It truly is a case of parroting some authority with smug confidence. Even when hiking it feels good to have knees over toes and a bit of a full extension. Those people must have never tried thinking for themselves
"A good friend of mine years ago was being given all sorts of shit from a ""friend"" as his cycle, like a different (unknown) compound every couple of weeks kind of shit and he went completely off the deep end. 

Went from a normal dude to being convinced people were following us as we walked through town. I thought he was joking at 1st till he just and took off like a sprinter running from... whatever. Took me ages to chase him down and get him settled. His head had totally gone.

Had to walk his 18 stone ass home by the arm like a little girl, and it took him months of not leaving his house to sort his shit out.

Wouldn't surprise me if someone on Olympia level cycles had a few meltdown moments."
I assume a non-zero number of people just rely on civil asset forfeiture to get their gear.
I agree with this 100%. In the hd footage it's pretty clear how Chris beats Terrence and Breon in almost all of the poses. And they posed *a lot*. And this is the morning session. I think a lot of people are basing their opinion on the shit stream or basically just piggybacking on what seems to be accepted wisdom right now that Chris scraped the win. All 5 judges had him number 1 and (obviously) they saw everyone up close and in 3d. Terrence has got better since last year no doubt but for me it wasn't all that close.
"Cutting can make you cold, and you might be sick too."
"Have to see a proper back pose but looks like that's your weakness

Also delts and triceps like the other guy said

Still very impressive though"
Torn biceps usually never go back to how they used to be
I like the term grow into your food. Just add a little more and see in a week.
"Just treat it like you would any other muscle group. 5x a week is frequency is not necessary, nor is a huge surplus.

Bret Contreras recommends doing one horizontally loaded hip extension movement (e.g. hip thrusts), one vertically loaded hip extension movement (e.g. sumo deadlift) and one unilateral squat-like movement (e.g. reverse lunges). 

Then you can do your abduction as well for the gluteus medius."
Yep
by all means man I love some entrepreneurial spirit. If you think that area‚Äôs lacking I‚Äôm sure you could get a pretty decent user base. App dev I imagine would be the hardest thing but small ads could probably offset all your costs in starting and operating.

"I wouldn‚Äôt say this is beyond normal, like if she had a large meal and relaxed her stomach (didn‚Äôt make any attempt at sucking in or flexing her abs) it is possible for this change.

"Agreed. Pre judging I feel like he was ahead with competition, but the evening show sealed the deal no question."
"I love the juxtaposition of your comment and question. To the former: I know you weren‚Äôt trying to be sexist, it just may have come across that way. That‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm on your side here.

In regards to anavar, while an otherwise relatively ‚Äúmild‚Äô oral steroid that can help both lean and harden greatly: it should always be taken with a test base. Anavar will absolutely suppress your testosterone level even at a low dose. Will it shut it down, not entirely but it will feel like it.

At a low dose (less than 30mg daily, taken twice at 15mg each) it is ‚Äúless‚Äù risky; however over time out can wreck your HDL and all it‚Äôs heart saving benefits, and, your liver. You can mitigate that by taking high omegas (fish oil) supplements, consume avocados, add flaxseed, etc. For liver health (non-alcoholic fatty liver which is common here): use TUDCA, milk thistle and a 2:1 combo of choline inositol and l‚Äômethionine.

Finally, get labs every 90 days: comprehensive metabolic panel with lipids and take a 90 day break off the anavar. AND always seek the advice of your physician for dosage and pharmacological matters. I may be my own doctor but I‚Äôm otherwise an internet gadfly. Good luck!"

It sucks but manual correcting and conscious effort is the way to fix posture. No amount of face pulls or whatever is going to fix it without that
holy fuck that‚Äôs a lot of weight
Dude cut that shit in half and actually put some work in to it. I have no idea why you would superset deadlifts with kettlebell swings but if you‚Äôre capable of doing that after FIVE movements you aren‚Äôt putting enough into any of them. This looks like you just looked at every machine in your gym and slapped them on a list.
lol all these words and nothing of value was said.
That's impressive for a natty. That's all. How many years have you been lifting?
üòÇ fuck it
Congrats on coming out the Victor.
"&gt; I am still confused on the amount of sets I need to do weekly per muscle group

as many as the well written and designed program you chose from someone with years of experience training themselves/others.

&gt;  if say you workout 10 total sets for your chest per week, and that's split between two days, so you only do like 2-3 exercises with 3 sets each for chest in a day?

if its 10 sets of chest a week, and you do 3 exercises and 3 sets, that leaves you 1 set for next chest day... 

&gt; Would you even ""feel"" the soreness after the workout with only 2-3 exercises

soreness isnt the most important thing, but if you actually train hard yea you would. problem is most people dont train hard.

&gt; I am in no way an experienced gym goer

see point one then about picking a program. the question you should be asking is: whats a good program for someone at my current experience leve which is (insert here)"
"lmao yeah, im thinking about doing a slow bulk just so i can get bigger legs. but its also pretty sick having veins everywhere so might just maintain for now"
"Any other people struggling with motivation to train-workout- rest just the whole lifestyle, since pandemic? Tips needed."
Then why did my cholesterol drop by 60+% when I went vegan? Lol
"Lol let me get this straight. You come to a subreddit specifically about bodybuilding right? This is not a general fitness or bodyweight fitness or crossfit bullshit subreddit. Then you ask if anyone knows anything about creatine HCL or if we recommend it. I ask you something because this is such a stupid quesiton it's almost impossible to tell if you're trolling or not. Then your response indicates that you think there's some massive difference between HCL or monohydrate. Creatine is creatine. Plain and simple.

You could have spent literally MINUTES doing a quick google search and found that the difference is in the absorption rate and you could take about half the amount of HCL as you do monohydrate, but due to the fact that HCL is more expensive, you're still paying about the same per serving of creatine. But you can't be assed to do a little research yourself, jackass."

This a small pp energy comment
"Fuck bb squats, Smith gang 4 lyfe"
"This is such a huge issue that I think could humanize bodybuilders to the outside communities. Just this week I was at a pool party with people making comments about my body in a positive way and their bodies in a negative way. I made a comment that I am insecure just like anyone else and they all responded like they were shocked. 

Getting fit and strong doesnt take away your insecurities, just changes them. It's never enough. Going to therapy helped me. 

What maybe helped the most was having friends who weren't in the gym. Seeing people have beautiful , fulfilling, happy lives while in bodies that I would hate myself to look like made me realize that my happiness is not tied to my fitness. Still a struggle."

Looking solid bro! Nice work
You might lose some endurance and weights might feel a bit heavier for a bit but your body will bounce back so fast
Lol okay homie I bet you know
What the fuck is this garbled garbage?
"&gt; Yes. I don't count fats/carbs but I do weight everything out and plan on doing so forever. Simply because I have low appetite (I started out at 5'11 120lb) and I will go back to eating nothing if left to by own devices. 

Sounds a lot like me. A lot of people don't track when they bulk. Others track to make sure they don't become a fat fuck. I track to make sure I'm eating *enough.*"
Love to hear you're doing so well my man.
You'll regret not having closeups of how your face / neck changes
God bless
"Ok hear me out for a minute guys. It's pretty commonly agreed that its significantly easier to regain muscle that you may have lost due to not training or other factors (i.e muscle memory). Plenty of studies and cases show that a lot of people are able to gain most of their muscle back within a short ish period of time.  ‚Äã

Now lets go to cutting. Almost everyone recommends doing a slow approach where you minimize muscle loss, and losing too much weight too quickly will make you lose all your gains. Now what I don't get (and to clarify this is entirely for people who don't COMPETE in bb shows) is why is it such a big deal to lose some muscle during a cut?

Wouldn't it be fine to lose a relatively decent amount of weight (obviously not doing something like a 50% deficit) and then afterwards bump your calories back up slightly to regain some muscle you lost? I can see this wouldn't work for people who want to be absolutely shredded to the bone with maximum muscle mass, but wouldn't it be okay otherwise? 

Thoughts? Or am I just a fuckin retard who ate one to many crayons today"

"Judges fucked up big time. They rewarded condition over size in Open class. They made a dangerous precedent. Clarida should have been 4th or 5th. Regan should have won, Sergio 2nd. Otherwise next year Clarida beats Ramy. Judges are so inconsistent, it's pathetic."

Supplements are considered poison because big phrama doesn't get their cut when people buy them.

"This makes me cringe and it makes me sad all at the same time.  Please lay off the gear if you really are using.  Fourteen is waaaay too young and the risks at your age are simply NOT WORTH IT.  

I know it's really hard to be self aware at 14, so please take this as constructive criticism so you'll know why people are giving you a hard time and down votes.  It might be difficult to hear this advice but I'm trying to help you.

Your physique isn't really anything worth posting lots of videos *and bragging about it*.  It's fine to post videos if you're humble about it and are simply asking for advice.  It's fine to be confident about your progress and compared to most 14 year olds you look good.

However, the video is not worth bragging about - too many glaring holes in your physique, no knowledge of posing and I don't even want to begin to try to understand what you think you're doing with the dumbbells.  

You just can't post something like this on a forum with active, professional, competing bodybuilders with the subcontext of ""hey look at me I'm so great,"" especially when NO ONE and I mean NO ONE on this forum is going to think it's a good idea for you to use gear.

On the other hand, I think it's great that you are interested in bodybuilding.  Starting young is wonderful - if you're patient and diligent and keep learning you can accomplish a lot of great things.   If you pursue bodybuilding with the attitude that you want to be the best version of yourself rather than simply better than others, you will have the right attitude.  Enthusiasm and passion are also admirable and useful traits - temper them with humility.

Good luck and keep training.  Learn as much as you can, get off the gear NOW and change your mindset."

Something that changed my perspective was doing a stint of PSMF.

I don't necessarily recommend that- it is much more mentally comfortable to have a stable daily average of intake &amp; scale weight. Don't want to get the rollercoaster started.

But I realized some things about appetite, satiety, taste, diversity in my diet. One of those, ""oh you think you're hungry at 1600? i'll show you what hunger is"". or, ""you're whining about not being able to eat what you want? well you have 1100 calories today, get creative &amp; learn about portion control; 500 of those go to chicken breast""

"NEVER. I used to do that shit all the time and genuinely thought that I was being super helpful. You'll learn very quickly that 9 out of 10 people will get defensive, standoffish, offended, etc.. and that 10th person *might* give you an awkward glance or 'thanks'

Unless someone is doing something nearby that might hurt me, I don't say a damn thing to anyone ever unless someone asks for help. The worst kind of advice in just about any situation is unsolicited advice."
Like 80-90% of the people who have elite totals especially in the 105kg categories and below pull sumo and when you get in the 74kg categories and below that percentage becomes almost 100%. One top 3 guy I can get off my head who doesn't pull sumo and isn't a SHW is Haack rn.
And your pp will b sad :-(
"To have good chances for a pro card you'd have to be at least around 170 at your height after the cut. You'd bulk up to 190-200 with a little higher bodyfat, then cut down to somewhere around 170. 

You don't need a lot of gear if you wanna go that route. Start small and take your time. Check out moreplatesmoredates and Anabolic Doc on youtube if you haven't already and inform yourself about risks and benefits. Good luck on your journey."

As far as Falcon... I've hated all the action scenes and it's really dragging the series down for me. I only really like Bucky and don't care about any of the other characters lol. WandaVision was so amazing for me (us) and this has just been a let down."

"Good question. I‚Äôve been on 160mg test E since about October of 2016, and I‚Äôll  throw in orals now and then for pre workout for 4 to 6 weeks when I‚Äôm feeling motivated.

Before that I‚Äôve ran test e, with various orals including anadrol, Diana ol, superdrol, etc. I used tren e also once but really couldn‚Äôt stand it and stopped after 6 weeks. I honestly don‚Äôt remember exact details but maybe about 6 cycles of test e starting at 600 mg only and up to 800 mg later on with orals? I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have the exact details of them really. I didn‚Äôt pct between cycles just dropped to a replacement dosage, and I have no intentions of not being on self administered trt, either."
Good shit. Keep going bro.
"Gotcha. Yeah my carbs mainly are coming from rice. Half way through my bulk my plan was to go to sweet potatoes so just change up flavor etc. 

I‚Äôll monitor it then as well, thank you!"

You have the upper body, but you don't have the lower body, you got a problem building downstairs.

Wouldn't you be able to move more weight and still fully contract your upper back? 

Not saying to toss out rows, but as far as traps development goes, moving your elbows don't provide more traps contraction, whereas it fatigues your arms"
It happens. Doesn‚Äôt seem like your strength has actually taken a hit though so that‚Äôs a win.

"Fitness Instagram is very repetitive.

Everyone using the same exact angles and the same cheesy hip hop/rock songs. The same inspirational mottos and gimmicks. It genuinely feels like the vast majority of fitness folks are imitating each other to the point of parody, trying to fulfill some fantasy version of what a fitness influencer is like in their mind. When you follow enough people, you realize the sameness of it. Shit, even this observation isn't original but it really hit me today.

I love bodybuilding and I love the aesthetic of the human body but it's like social media bubble completely zapped the creativity out of it.

I post less because of it. No one needs to see my bicep pose every other day with some Ace Mask blasting in the background and know I'm a lion among sheep that hustles like I'm hungry and am too legit to quit."

Yeah basically cut down after training for 3 1/2 years for a show I didn‚Äôt get to do. From 101kg -87kg now. Going to stay on a slight surplus so I don‚Äôt get to fluffy and aim for 92kg
You could try less frequency like a ULxULA (a indicating a day where you focus on a weakpoint or a PPLxUL. You could also do a bro split but itd probably best to set it up in such a way that each muscle group gets some volume 2x a week (chest on Monday and then chest gets additional volume on arms from dips)

Ahh damn. Gonna chalk this one up to the cutting fog
"To answer the question you asked, yes. You could do only one well-planned cycle, and almost certainly you‚Äôd return to normal. You would add a few kilos of muscle and if you continued to train effectively you‚Äôd hold onto about half of what you gained on cycle. A lot of other people chimed into the other considerations and I‚Äôll defer to them."

The previous two times I injured myself, it was extremely painful after the initial injury and fully recovered in a week.  This time around it's been gradually just getting worse and now I'm at the point where I don't feel comfortable lifting because I know it'll make the pain worse.  I got an appointment with a physician for next week and 3 physical therapy appointments for the end of November and beginning of December.  I'm hoping nothing is too fucked up.  The last thing I'd want to see is a fucking spinal erector injury end my lifting days üôÅ

I'm taking this week off from lifting... Or at least lower body stuff idk I might do some upper body pump work just for the sake of it.  But yeah hoping next week I feel better.  Probably not gonna do back squats any time soon, but if I can deadlift and do safety bar squats, I'll be happy."

"this is the worst discovery to make when lifting. but it's true. you have to train up to higher weights. you can't just hit 135 for 40 reps and assume you can hit 275 for 5. you need to train your rep ranges to higher weights too. but, to some extent there are rules of thumbs that seem to work. most guys ive talked to and in my own experience, once i was able to bench 135 clean for a set of 20, no pauses between reps, i was able to hit 225 for 1."
I think you mean stunning.
You would just waste time gaining and losing glycogen storage.
"Great breakdown, champ."

"Yeah I agree but having room to grow doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs automatically going to win, it depends where that mass is added and on a lot of other factors that‚Äôs all.

Ok cool do you have literally any source that shows this?

It just sucks since these three friends don't live in the same city, this isn't like a weekly thing, last time I've seen them was February."
This is encouraging man. Thanks for sharing.

Nah buddy these mouth breathers are everywhere.
"On the bright side, my time as a trainer made me fucking *hate* going to local gyms because people would constantly approach me while I worked out on my own time. There were even multiple times at school (22 miles away) where total rando's I can't remember ever speaking to were like ""oh shit you're the trainer at so n so!"" I constantly had to keep up bullshit convos with rando's all over the place to maintain a good social record at my job and it sucked."

"Agree completely, but I'm one of those people.

Bodybuilding has changed, you've got to establish a social presence and as a non-famous fitness orientated account it's nearly impossible to be creative while balancing actual bodybuilding rather than just being in shape 247.

There are lots of unique accounts, most famous and enabled to be so because of it, but then chicken and egg...

It's hard man, I'd love the 90s 00s bodybuilding without this shit but if you want a sponsorship one day you've got to lean into social and post daily, making it so fucking difficult not to create repetitive vain looking content.

"The quickest way I improved my pullups was by doing sets of an easy amount of reps multiple times a day. Every time I went to the bathroom I would do a set of 2‚Ä¶ I drink a lot of water so I averaged about 30 pullups throughout the day.

Then at the gym I would do working sets of 10x3.

They honestly could've done with that, or even could've done with relating her to anybody in the story.

Again, I just hate how a Palpatine won the entire game, no matter how light side or dark side she is."

"I easily pee 10 times a day. I do drink at least 4-5 liters of liquids a day though with a shit ton of diet soda included. I was paranoid about diabetes and kidney problems too, especially since I was a fat fuck (around 330 lbs at my highest) since I was like 6 up until my early/mid twenties. I just turned 30 last week, so I decided it's time to bite the bullet and face the damage I have done, so talked to my doctor. I just got my lab results (the usual lab work, endocrin profile, pee sample, lung x-ray, everything) on friday.

"üëå will implement, thanks. Any suggestion for rep ranges or anything?"
"The full answer would be ridiculously long and complex, but the simplified version: I did blood work for every thing I could that, if out of range; can be nephrotoxic (thyroid, estrogen, testosterone, cholesterol, etc.) and if anything was in a range that would be considered hard on the kidneys I worked on correcting it and retested to confirm. The diet of course as you noted was also big. Also astragalus root supplement is a god send. Grape seed extract, citrus bergamot, superbio curcumin. You want to have good blood sugars and blood pressure as those things can both cause kidney damage, too. Essentially I made sure everything in my body is ‚Äòpro‚Äô kidney and functioning in a manner to help my kidneys. I then targeted the kidneys themselves with the supplements noted and a few other things. These are things a normal healthy person wouldn‚Äôt really need to do but in a situation like my own it has made all the difference. I methodically made changes and tested before, during, and after via blood work and test strips - until I honed in on the best system for me."
Gain train?
"One of my better buys, yeah.  $400 pre covid.  It's not a super nice (or heavy stack) one as far as freemotion goes as it was specifically made for home and sold at Costco for like $2k back in the day.

"Okay serious question, what is the ideal weight to rep/set range to acquire this type of physic !? Is it heavy more sets low rep, or light more reps nor set !? If your 150lbs but strong and gain muscle easily. Also how do you get bigger quads."
"Quads and Hams are like equal, flex wins on calves, even with Lees very solid calves. At least imo"
This is why most people should avoid deadlifts or use trap bar deadlifts like me
"I disagree as I think most do with you, just say you like a freakish physique over aesthetic one, I think most yearn to have the classic physique like this get the recognition they deserve. It's called bodybuilding,  that includes making the body extremely conditioned, nobody was more conditioned than Rhoden in 2018. Just my opinion."

Ibuprofen worked by inhibiting prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are a key factor in inflammation and pain but are also a signaling molecule for the stomachs mucosa membrane to produce mucus.

"Newbie here, Trying to cut down to see my abs for the first time in forever. Currently doing 1800 a day. But is that not enough?

&amp;#x200B;

Im 37, 5'11 and 184 pounds. I exercise 4-5 days a week for about 1 hour. Nothing special just short fast full body workout. I eat 95% clean. Mostly eggs/oats/spinach/etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Been doing this for 5 months so far. My start weight was 200 pounds 5 months ago. Again, its 184 now. But if I sweat it out in the steam room at my gym I get down to 179 usually. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how long till I can start to see my abs? Is 1800 calories a day too much? Should it be lower with my given stats?"
Yea but that means free pizzas apparently
You're still beautiful bb

"I finally found a good gym partner. New guy at work who was already doing bodybuilding workouts, but didn't do anything but calisthenics for a year due to covid. He Is pretty strong too. I'm excited to finally have someone that can help push me while actually putting good effort."
"I‚Äôm in the same position (30lb dumbbells and a bench) and I find chest to be one of the easiest things to train.

"I like the Jung route for dreams. If you have a therapist it helps to have them do it but it is possible to run through it on your own.

Accept the dream as true. That is, your non-conscious mind has an opinion, and it‚Äôs trying to plainly tel your conscious mind about it. It‚Äôs your (and ideally your therapist as well) job to fill in the blanks until an explanation is found which as your conscious mind‚Äôs complete voluntary assent. That ‚Äúclick‚Äù moment is when you‚Äôve figure out the dream for all practical purposes.

Again stressing this has a much higher probability of working with a therapist."

"""A few seconds of Panic"" was a really great read that really helped a younger me see the difference between a fit person and a professional athlete.

The author is a sports writer, Stefan Faris, who was fascinated with George Plimpton, a sports writer from the 50s and 60s. Plimpton was known for his ""participatory journalism"", he played a few exhibition games in the MLB, played a few games as a backup QB for the Lions and the Colts, backup goalie for the Bruins, played a few rounds on the PGA tour.

Stefan wanted to recreate this style of journalism, and the only thing he figured his 40something year old body could handle was trying to become an NFL calibre place kicker. Anyways, it was a pretty cool book, especially if you're in to the NFL.

&gt;A Few Seconds of Panic is a nonfiction first-person narrative by Stefan Fatsis, published in 2008. The book chronicles Fatsis, a professional 43-year-old sportswriter working for The Wall Street Journal, and his attempt to play in the National Football League. Along the way, he relates the personal stories and struggles that professional football players face in the league. After some setbacks, Fatsis eventually finds some success as a backup placekicker for the Denver Broncos.The book's title comes from Jason Elam's description of being a kicker as ""hours and hours of boredom surrounded by a few seconds of panic."""

"So ideally you want to be hitting each muscle group about twice per week, so if I was working out 2 days a week I'd personally do full body every time. 

That said, if you enjoy your current split and it keeps you going back to the (home)gym then that's great! Consistency is the most important thing, so no point doing full body twice a week work outs if you hate it and end up quitting after a month."

I started to cut 10 days ago and 3 days ago during some dumbbell bench press i got some minor rotator cuff pain (enough to keep me from lifting). Its getting better but i dont want to rush back into the gym and reinjure it/stop the healing process. What should i do to  keep losing dat but still keeping muscle? Could lifting at a lower weight be enough to keep muscle and prevent me from losing all my hard earned gains ?
"I hit it by accident after spending ten weeks focusing primarily on heavy overhead pressing and benching maybe once per week. Once I could fairly comfortably press more than my bodyweight (I was about 190 at the time, and could press 195) I got the bench pretty easily. Rep scheme for pressing was usually 10x3 with 5RM. Did lots of weighted dips as well."

"I'd run a smaller deficit than you have been and bring protein up to between 1.5 and 2grams/kg of bodyweight (between 142 and 190grams based on 210lbs). Higher protein intake helps maintain more muscle mass while losing fat and combined with your weight training you should be able to make progress while in a slight deficit. Too much of a deficit will hurt your progress though. Remember, it's not about eating less but eating the proper amount for your goals. Metabolism does increase as lean mass increases and decreases with an increase in body fat, so building muscle will help get you closer to the look you want. That's what I'd put the focus on now if I were in your place. Great job so far man"

This is assuming you have decent athletic baseline stats such as strength and flexibility.

"Honest feedback, you have enough time to hit the level of conditioning well, but a) you will lose more muscle due to the suicide cut required at this point and b) it will be tougher to maintain peak physique before your body forces you to start holding water.

Also think you could use a better posing coach.  You aren't stiff, but you're a big guy and this posing isn't showing off your best attributes.

You will find out on your next show it is a lot easier and better for your physique to be closer to stage weight at 6 weeks out than where you currently are.  You definitely don't want to force your body to lose enough body fat that your conditioning is great and then the next week ask it to go to an extreme level of dehydration.  A lot better to get 90% close to stage weight a month out and then dial in the last 10% at two weeks out."

"If you're looking like that being natty yeah you can compete for sure, and with good results probably."
"They're fine. I lift in flat Ryderwear which are similar to wrestling shoes. Some movements I prefer to swap out olympic shoes for, but not out of necessity. The elevated heel can improve rom on some leg exercises. Anyway, yeah nothing at all wrong with a flat heel. Many people swear by chucks (too narrow for me)."
I worry the grip masters and hand clamps are gonna mess up my joints so I tend to stay away from them. I've never really heard of any pros using them as well besides arm wrestlers.

"Interesting paper and definitely makes some good points but I'm not sure I'm on board with the author's base assumption: ""masculinity is first and foremost a performance for other men"".


Is that true? Isn't masculinity just the group of characteristics that have been selected for in males due to the fact that humans reproduce sexually?"

"Best, if any, supplement to help with noob gains? I don‚Äôt take any supplements other than drinking a mixed protein powder sometimes for extra calories. I‚Äôm eating at probably a minor surplus. Currently still experiencing soreness after each workout which I imagine will dwindle down in a couple weeks. Should I just save my money? I‚Äôm not into caffeinated preworkouts because I take adderall in the morning and the shit makes my heart go haywire every now and then. BCAAs? Creatine? Shut the fuck up noob and keep lifting? Just curious if any really changed the game"
"Sort of is fine, comes with the territory of intense training and beating the logbook. 

When it gets to the point where you‚Äôre anxious as fuck and genuinely would rather do anything else but get under that weight you should probably do another movement or deload."

"Best thing to do is research before buying. TBH, if you want to get into crypto you are best to test the waters by buying ""legit"" coins like ETH, BTC, XRP (people will say ""XRP is a scam"" but they are idiots and fail to do proper research or read headlines), etc so you gain an understanding.

1. Start by downloading the Coingecko app which gives all the coins available and you can scroll through it to check each one and what exchanges they're available on.
2. Download a wallet like Atomic wallet or if you plan on spending alot of cash, nano ledger since its offline and harder to hack or access.
3. Sign up to an exchange like Binance or Coinbase (CB has higher fees though), and see how you can buy and then look at how to send from the exchange to your wallet.
4. Once you buy, hold. IMO, alot of people cant handle volatility so they sell way too early. Depending on where you live, if you can buy and hold for 12 months you pay less tax.
5. Don't jump on these stupid meme coins or other retarded scam like coins unless you are willing to lose what you spend and/or you are like me and already made a lot of profits so don't care to lose any lol."

"Can't put it flat on the ground, it strains my calf muscle.

Thank you! This is what I‚Äôve been saying. Leg mass is somewhat genetic. I train my legs hard as fuck and I know everyone from amateur to pro that I‚Äôve met or seen do as well. Others may train legs differently (more athletic focus). It genuinely sounds ignorant and petty when people try to take away from a great physique‚Äôs credit by bitching about legs in a division with shorts. It‚Äôs a different division with different qualities to be admired. Just because you won‚Äôt accredit them doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt present.

"Assuming you are responsible enough to limit yourself: Ask for as high a limit as you can in my opinion. They‚Äôll approve you for as much as they can based on your income and payment history (some companies only care about your history with them, like CapitalOne, while some care about your entire credit report). This will improve your score significantly and even more so if you keep your utilization low."
"Congrats! I know bodybuilding is a lot more healthy for your body then anorexia, but be sure you're not swapping one body insecurity for another. Sure, bodybuilding is healthy and a ""good"" obsession, but if the mindsets the same one where you feel like you have to be built otherwise you're super ugly and worth it, then I would reccomend working on that so you can approach bodybuilding from a healthier perspective. 

I'm not saying this is you or anything, if it's not feel free to ignore this, but I've known a couple people who have just switched the method, kept the mindset, so I thought I'd just say. Best of luck to you man!"

Yeah you're exactly right. That is something I struggle with posing wise. I've been working on it. Part of it is the posing and part of it is needing to be leaner. I appreciate your feedback and thanks so much!

"Correct. He can still continue to improve but he could achieve what would take him 10 more years of natural training in less than 6 months if he's enhanced. You don't need to blow up to Olympia size just because you start juicing. You can instead simply achieve a much fuller, leaner physique than you could otherwise achieve naturally. Now don't misunderstand, he still looks good. And he can look better naturally. But being enhanced would just make him go beyond that and much faster."

"Nah friend, it's not just about her mass.

It's about being this freaking lean as a woman to boot.

Not even a myostatin deficiency could help her there.

It's always about the lean mass. Generally you can be big or lean natty. Not both. Especially not as a woman."
"Yeah I‚Äôm not looking to rush right back into it without the green light from the physio. I‚Äôll make sure to ask about alternative exercises and those ones you‚Äôve mentioned, thank you!"
You have a good bone structure and you're lean. You need to give it more than 2 months especially if your home equipment isn't extensive. Give it a year to see some real gains if your training and nutrition is good.

"Was bulking and got sick of eating, to the point where I dreaded every meal. So I just relaxed my diet a bit. Then I got the first COVID shot which put me down for about a day and a half, and then I got sick after that (basically back to normal now). End result is that I've lost 7-8 lbs of ~~pure dense lean rock-hard contractile tissue~~ water and glycogen. Going to bulk for the next two weeks to sort of ""reset"", and then start a brief cut for summer.

It's funny when you get sick and drop down to a weight you haven't been in forever, but you obviously didn't just lose fat, so you look flat instead of shredded."
"It‚Äôs cool! I understand, I‚Äôm no where near close to being able to compete but I‚Äôm just so excited. I train like I‚Äôm 150 weeks out lol"
Thank you for those kind words!
"One of the best things you can do is limit your social media.

This is one of the only places I check anymore as it's low-key here and positive. I got rid of Facebook/Instagram/etc. because those sites are built to rile up your emotions both good and bad. They're also built to be addicting.

If there are certain pages you view that just serve to stress you out and don't add anything to your life, unsubscribe from them for a bit. Try turning off social media notifications. You might find your mental state to be better."

"Yes. A growing theory among historians is that Europe‚Äôs colonization of the Americas was made substantially easier by a wave of disease that wiped out about half of the indigenous population shortly before Columbus‚Äô arrival.

Further, CAFO‚Äôs/over use of antibiotics are a major concern because they are a breeding ground for ‚Äòsuperbugs,‚Äô which are hard-to-kill diseases.

But I think I want bodybuilding to be my career in the very best future.

"When doing db presses its fine to have scapular protraction during the concentric and then retraction on the eccentric. Look at paul carter on instagram he explains it further in depth.

To get a better contraction try doing these if you havent already
- slowing the eccentric and the concentric a bit to get better tension.
-doing a pre exhaust exercise before it like pec deck.
-do some mountain dog chest activations before you train chest. He has the exercises on youtube. One is just a banded press focusing on squeezing the chest at the top and then the other exercise is one arm straight infront of you pushing into a pole contracting your chest for 10seconds(like the end of a pec deck motion)

Hopefully those help"
Eat fewer oats. Like a normal serving.

"Fantastic physique, but there‚Äôs zero reason to hop on gear at 16. Like I started when I was 20, which is still too young in most people‚Äôs opinion, and did so so that I could get in a solid few cycles before I aged out of juniors.

"Honestly first GF came before the sex GF and we'd been friends for a while and she asked me out so that was definitely helpful getting my feet wet initially.  Definitely learned some lessons about the importance of just being myself and having boundaries and not being a pushover or being only concerned with pleasing my partner.

   First sex GF had been a brief acquaintance and knew somewhat of me from way back around my freshman year of high school.  And again that sort of helped because apparently she had a crush on me back then. I actually ran across her on a dating site and started messaging not knowing who she was at all but she recognized me.

  I honestly did most of my out of shell/man whoring through apps/sites.  And then going on dates and just kind of getting used to the whole thing.  Never really did any pickup thing.  And yeah even with apps it can be a bit hard and discouraging at times."

I could literally eat only this shit mixed with 1l of milk per day and have great macros, never cook, and never have to count calories lol plus its about $2 per serving, so thats only $10 a day.

"Looks super solid in the torso.  Good shoulders, arms, good flow to the upper body in the front.  Good taper from the front.

Back looks great.  Excellent development all around.  Don‚Äôt forget to get your triceps popping when you‚Äôre doing opening up your lats - it‚Äôs like your hammies- it‚Äôs not technically your back but it contributes to the overall flow of the pose more than you‚Äôd think.  Super good shape of the torso from the back.  Do y‚Äôall not do standing lat spreads the way the men do them?  Ham out tucked arms @ your lower back, and then spread the freedom cobra?

Legs look great from the front while flexed

Some possible criticism.  Obviously a week out is too late to do anything about it, but food for thought for the future perhaps.

Weird camera angle.  Harder to judge.  Could be a big brain move if the judges are positioned the same way.

Legs look great from the front while flexed, but a little soft from behind, where a lot of the girls really go nuts on conditioning, so you may stand out with weaker hammies.

A little oblique conditioning to differentiate the core would help a lot, break up that soft area with a few lines.  Same with the serratus minor.

Thoughts, obviously I am not a judge.  You look super proportionate, have a great flowing physique, and N excellent taper.  Good luck in your comp!"

"Welcome back!

&gt;Has MM or ON Whey go down in quality in the past decade+?

I used to be a hardcore ON Whey consumer years ago.  IMO their quality has gone down significantly.  MM has always had the issue of so many extra cals/macros when I just wanted the protein (stupid tasty back in 2007 though).

I'm a big fan of REDCON1 MRE Lite.  Most of the flavors are great. except apple pie and Smores (especially horrid).  If you sign up for their promo emails, they run BOGO protein on an off regular basis."

Damn you got a pretty inspiring story for those of us trying to lose a lot of fat. I've always struggled with weight but been lifting hard and dieting the last 4 months and put on a lot of muscle while losing 14kg so far. Looking forward to hitting a good weight (probably around 10kg more) so I can start eating more and hopefully keep the noob gains rolling a little longer.

It has to to with how many calories I should be eating. My weight is currently 100 kg (220 lbs) and I am going down to 85 kg (187 lbs) during the coming 16 weeks. My Lifesum app calculated that I should be eating about 2000 calories a day. I have also connected the Lifesum app with my Fitbit watch so it tracks the number of calories automatically. 

For example today I have walked 17.000 steps and I also did a pull workout at the gym. Lifesum says that I should be eating 1500 calories extra today then. But I have heard that Fitbit often tracks more calories burnt than you actually burn and 3500 cals a day seems a bit too much for a cut right, What should I do?"

[According to some Nipple guy](https://youtu.be/_oyxCn2iSjU), the SDL starts from the ground and the RDL starts just below the knee (or from a low rack position).

A rack pull is like a RDL from slightly higher, just about at the knee.

All of this is relative to your own body, some people have short torsos with long arms, the difference between SDL, RDL, and rack pull for someone like that might be damn near negligible. On the opposite end of the spectrum, all the T-Rex manlets might have a very noticeable difference between those 3 starting points."

No way your that metrics. Arnold was one inch shorter and same weight an he looked like a giant next to you at that level of lean.

Honestly dude if you‚Äôre not intending to compete in powerlifting just use straps for your pulling movements. Nobody gives a shit about your grip strength (outside of PL/strongman) and using straps usually helps with mind-muscle connection on back movements.
im getting last place for sure save the gas money lmao

"I do see your point but to argue against it, were you making good choices at 15? Were you able to think long term and plan for your future at that age? I sure as fuck wasn‚Äôt. Teenagers are impulsive and shortsighted. He‚Äôs a sophomore in high school he‚Äôs worrying about the wrong test. 

I just watched a video by MorePlatesMoreDates from sometime last month about kids this age taking SARMs and he covered a lot of stuff that could *potentially* happen as a result. The risk is so much greater than the reward, especially when you‚Äôre still going through puberty. Not to mention that this kid can make linear progress for a significant amount of time, he‚Äôs fucking 15. What is the point of going on juice before you have any idea of your natty potential? 

And sure, a lot of body builders were able to grow to a normal size after using gear. But we‚Äôre biased because we‚Äôre seeing the success stories of using gear young."

My gym is starting to get a ton of complaints about the mask mandate during workouts. Which is funny because 9/10 people I see are doing half rom tricep pushdowns and resting 5 minutes between sets. If you're gonna whine about masks at least work harder lol.

"Yeah that's true. I was thinking of really dark skinned black people. If that skin color is achievable with mt2, or if there's a genetic limit that stops white people from getting that dark. 

I know this is a weird topic, lol. Just my strange mind being curious. Dosing mt2 high isn't a fun, the nausea is intense (I've accidentally misdoses it 10x once, 1mg instead of 100mcg, or whatever the standard doses are). So maybe that's a limiting factor in itself."
Good decision to prep longer. I'd try to get in more posing practice as well.

"Should I take creatine or not ?
I have tried creatine twice and did not really feel that I could lift more or looked better taking it than I did without it. I gave it a bottle's worth each time.

Creatine, however, seems to be a godsend for everyone else. My former roommate and I were about the same size, but his arms are like twice the size they were and it only took a semester. This kid my brother went to school with is 2 years younger than me and has only been working out a year and he looks bigger than me who's been working out for over a decade. I also have another friend who's freakingshly large and he looked like he was 100 pounds soaking wet only a few years ago.

Do I need to give creatine another chance and take it longer? It can be disheartening to see others that have worked out for such a shorter amount of time be in better shape than you even after dieting and working out consistently."

"I appreciate how Nick looks 100% and I don‚Äôt want to see an athlete I‚Äôve really enjoyed following die or destroy their physique. Have you not noticed how much his waistline grew and how bloated he was during guest posing with Clarida? Dallas bloated to the point where his abs were almost completely washed and the separation between his abs just kept growing. 

Roelly downsized and took a better approach in recent years and it‚Äôs only made him better. Ruhl bloated up and looked like a freak - he was more of a spectacle than a genuine contender. 

Do you honestly think something like this is sustainable? I want to see Nick winning shows into his 30‚Äôs. Even Ramy‚Äôs transformation took twice as long as Nick‚Äôs did. 

Every single part of Nick has grown and his gut has been no exception. It‚Äôs not sustainable."
"It seems like he actually enjoys what he‚Äôs doing on some level. Let him have that.

You don‚Äôt have to enjoy the same things as other people. The fact that he‚Äôs studying and you‚Äôre not doesn‚Äôt reflect poorly on you. You‚Äôve got a 3.4 GPA, you‚Äôre good bro.

Yeah I mean depending on where your running is now I don't think the upper body will be an issue regardless of the intensity as long as your diet is in check and supports all the activity. Leg volume is another story. I would decide on a running plan based on when your race date is or just for when you plan on accomplishing it that works for your style and then kinda drop in the leg days as you see fit depending on how you're feeling.

Dude fucked up not once but twice. He ain't coming back from this. He totally fucked that surgery and pec up now. Should of took a year off and REST AND RECOVERED.

"Again, we are talking about serious lifters here. People who are actively trying to get stronger in their training. 315 is not ""incredibly difficult"", idk what to tell you. 405 is ""incredibly difficult"" and probably beyond the ability of the average lifter, not 315.

For the average lifter who just fucks around in the gym, who I suspect is who you are talking about, 225 is probably tough for them. That doesn't mean 225 is notable whatsoever for serious lifters. 

You have to go down to the -145 class for a 315 bench to even be relevant, I would not consider that an ""incredibly difficult"" achievement for the average serious lifter.

Again, it's ok to have low standards but it's not ok to use them to accuse others of being disingenuous."

its strange that i can only get exactly 6 hours. do you think this hinders my recovery?
"Probably an important preface, I can't have my phone at work :/"
"Sounds like a mature approach! Age is an important factor but even more than that IMO is learning what works best for your body, nailing your training and diet and getting to that point where gains start being slow. 

Also as you already suppose, once you do one cycle you'll most likely end up doing more so it implies some kind of commitment to this haha."
Lol. The first time I tried it I couldn't believe it. It felt like I had taken nothing at all.
"Is it okay to do pushups daily on top of doing chest (bench, incline etc.) twice a week? Is there enough recovery here for the average person?"

Her personality (or lack thereof) and/or her being boring shouldn't be what makes or breaks a relationship. Before going any further you need to ask her if you may pick up her scent to judge if you two would be a match. Start there and the rest will fall in place.
Seriously. Intentional tension will make you grow. Stop doing exercises where you can‚Äôt create tension in the primary muscle you‚Äôre trying to target. Move on. Find a movement that makes your muscle feel like its gonna pop and you‚Äôll grow.

"6+ miles a day.

"Idk man I don‚Äôt have a kid but I only lasted about 4 years with the bodybuilding lifestyle: leaving the gym dripping in sweat, perfect macros, not drinking, sleeping 7-8 hours. I know some people can sustain that long term but after awhile I just got burnt out. If you just want to look good instead of step on stage 50% effort gets 80% of the results. 

I was pretty happy with how I looked after those 4 years so I‚Äôve spent the next 4-5 years just maintaining. Lower intensity gym sessions (which are much more enjoyable to me), more days off, occasionally drinking, making sure I get enough protein but being more lenient on my diet, and not doing extreme bulks/cuts where I swing 30 lbs in a few months. Pretty much maintained the exact physique I had so it‚Äôs working out. I still enjoy lifting and would never stop, but I can‚Äôt center my life around bodybuilding anymore"
does he bring a duffel full of towels lol? theres older guy with lifting gloves at my gym who talks to every girl in there every single day
No HARD feelings
Absolutely that. The discomfort of being weaker in any way would be greater than the discomfort of having to get that 5th meal in. I just wanted to know if any regular lifters out there are absolutely sick of eating 5k calories of clean food just to maintain their mass. I agree I sounded miserable and whiny and I probably should have phrased it better.
"If you can, have a shake with EAAs and dextrose to sip throughout your workout."
"I‚Äôm a noob and when I started lifting I was average strength ~20-22% bf. I plan to lean bulk until a couple months before next summer then cut until and through summer. Will 5lbs a month do that for me? I was thinking 10 but then I‚Äôd be obese in about 3 months. Is that a good plan? Will I build a lot of muscle doing that? Also, what if I go over my 5lb goal? Do I cut back till I‚Äôm at the 5lbs? Or put on less the next month? I think I wouldn‚Äôt be much heavier because of muscle since I think I‚Äôll build a uniform amount of muscle every month, it‚Äôll just be because I hit up the Golden Corral buffet one too many times."
"I disagree, but I think we feel the same but word it differently: videogames became more and more about a business. Cyberpunk is such a great example. They cut SO much, and left so much unfinished because they had to please people who aren‚Äôt game designers but run the company or invest money. People WANT to make games with charm and you can see the charm, but often a lot of the charm gets left on someone‚Äôs desktop unfinished. 

Then there‚Äôs games like assassins creed which are literally a timeline of how video games lose charm. The first one was a groundbreaking cool idea totally unique and awesome for its time. Then some boss saw it made money and it‚Äôs been the same garbage over and over. But you can literally see that the designers not in charge are trying their best to make it into art but the company isn‚Äôt letting them. 


 Video games used to not be some mega industry and were driven by passionate designers."

Yeah lol...I sometimes wish I can go back to when I weighed 147 lbs and maintenance was 2400 calories.

Pec however feels discomfort when flexing really hard, so taking a break from pressing for 2 weeks and rehabbing. I have no idea if it's a tear as the whole area feels much better."

"Ok, I‚Äôm starting to see based on this photo comparison, why everyone is so hype about this ‚Äúmutant‚Äù which I think is a very apt name. I can see much deeper cuts and definition. Now maybe I‚Äôm not as ‚Äúgay‚Äù as y‚Äôall (but I‚Äôm pretty gay lol) but I‚Äôm just trying to understand from a ‚Äúlayman‚Äôs aesthetics‚Äù point of view, and as a woman and an artist that loves the human form and great peeps like Frank Frazetta, (also involved in the body building world). 

So from my perspective the other guy on the left looks ‚Äúmore attractive‚Äù to me. Like the smoothness and full fill in his pecs is so much nicer than this cut on Nick. However I can see how being able to see a clearer connection from the pecs to the deltoid would be appealing to judges where the other dude has this sort of cleavage thing going on with his pits. 

But, as a female who‚Äôs merely fascinated, mutant isn‚Äôt .... mmm so fuckable pretty roflmao..: (like ok maybe monster CNC I can see lol, I can get into that fetish) but over all I‚Äôm kinda digging the other guy.

Yeah I think the adductors are well developed but they are high. Kinda like his calves
Ok
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand bodybuilding. The gains are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the exercises will go over a typical gym-goers head. There's also Arnold's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the physical capacity to truly appreciate the depths of squats, to realize that they're not just muscles - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike bodybuilding truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Zyzz's existential catchphrase ""We're all gonna make it"" which itself is a cryptic reference to working out. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Eugen Sandow's genius fortitude unfolds itself inside their gyms. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ

And yes, by the way, i DO have a dumbbell tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5lb of my deadlift PR (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé"
Yes
Dude looking like George Kittle but somehow even more of a beast
Yeah get the gyno fixed. Your very lean so it will very noticeable and judges will knock you. Also if you start to cycle more and more it‚Äôs only going to get worst. Not sure if any AI / Serms can help at this point to reverse.
we both win we made people laugh
Kill your lifts for Harambe today everyone.
"You may want to check out VAERS. There's been plenty of really bad adverse reactions to the vaccine including death. For these people with horrible reactions, it's usually must worse than the virus. I had a close friend of mine who just got her booster shot and she had literally insane side effects from it the night she got it. I can honestly tell they seriously freaked her out and she says she doesn't plan on getting the vax again. My family and I have all had the virus and I'm sorry to disappoint the scare mongers, but it was not scary in the slightest. Some of these family members of mine are quite up there in age as well."

Yeah this is purely my opinion but I‚Äôd imagine you would have a stronger or a weaker reaction if you previously had COVID
"Great physique with a good amount of attention. HOWEVER, you still require more size before considering a run at a pro card.
Especially from the rear, more lower lat and trap density along with triceps needing some attention. Not to mention you need to be leaner"
Holy FUCK dog u look phenomenal bro legit go kill that show
"Wrong sub my dude. This is the competitive bb sub. Try r/gym or r/fit or smth? To answer your question all of Jeff‚Äôs programs are very ‚Äúpowerbuildy‚Äù, kind of a hybrid between strength and aesthetics. You don‚Äôt need to do 6 a week as a beginner IMO, you can do PPL in 5 days in a week with 6 different training days (so you do each workout every 8 days or so).

Generally don‚Äôt worry about specifics of programming as a beginner. Nuances of programming make a 5% difference. Get your form down, train hard, eat well, be consistent, worry about specifics later"
Franco won when his physique wasn't half as good as in his prime and he had terrible gyno as well. Most people believe one of Danny Padilla or Franco Columbu should've won.

"A good personality?  

What's your preferred lift for improving that?  

Also, got a sets and reps scheme to follow?"
"You are just standing straight up, not showing legs, and standing with feet parallel. You need to start from the ground, put one foot back and raise the heel to flex the quad/hamstring. Toes pointed slightly out, lean back flare lats, and once the lats are fully flared, arch your back into the pose. Almost want to think about forming a curve with your spine. What this does is showcases the thickness of your back, pops the erectors, and with your lats fully flared you have the optimal v-taper you are going to have"
"yeah she wanted me to go and see her again last night, didn't even respond to that lol"
Honestly man I've been working on it my entire life. You guys might think im an asshole but I don't think I've done anything the deserve this kind of attention in a long time. I dont delete my accounts because of embarrassment or ridicule like some people seem to think. I do it because I know I can be a dick when im feeling like shit and deleting my account is the only way to keep it from getting to this sub. I do the same shit irl. If im not posting im probably completely isolated from people

"Man it's finally good to see someone actually ready for a show. 95%of the posts in this sub are terrible. People with poor proportions, bad conditioning and even worse posing. I know we all need to start somewhere but people can't take feedback when you tell them an area they can improve on. You sir look great and your poses are nice and comfortable. Hammies quads all look conditioned and most importantly you have 7 weeks to still being it in, nice and slow you keep you size. Congrats. Only thing I can say is maybe more width and thickness on your back but overall you look great."

Thank you!

You‚Äôre an idiot. I‚Äôm not allowed to go below parallel on squats and not allowed to go knees to arm pits on the leg press. Go ahead and take restrictions I‚Äôve complained about as proof I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. Also please take the trash out and get the fuck off my social media.
33 5ft 8 190 pounds.  Been cutting on keto so I feel I look pretty deflated despite being 190. I hold a lot of weight in my legs on top of that.  Anyways how terrible am I doing fam?http://imgur.com/a/MkQzGdw
Lol trust I know exactly what your trying to say.  I agree it looks good when done proper.
"For the last 2-3 years I've focused fully on my relationship, my puppy, school and making sure the economics add up as best as they can. Had no time or money for BB, so I just cruised on shit food and no expectations for myself. Went up 45lbs, but I ate some good fucking food doing so so no regrets.

I finished my studies last summer, but my city has been in lockdown since then, as well as the gym chains. Finally this week they opened up again. Been working out every day and getting back to dieting to get back in shape. Excited for more noobgains as I cut away most of this fat I packed on.

What's even more epic is my decisions fully paid off. I'm renting a decent place in downtown \[city\], I make enough to save aggressively for buying a house in the future, and I make almost double what I did in my old job. My old job was also part-time in healthcare, so I had to fill in shifts to make the economics add up back then, but now in IT I just chill. I know exactly which hours I work, I can flex them around if I need, and I make sick cash compared to the high-stress shit I had before.

I'm fat as fuck, I'm small and I'm weak -- But I made it, brahs. The rest is just diet and weights."
"I got deja vu reading this. I'm pretty sure i've seen someone else ask this before lmao

Was not trying to say you are making a lame excuse.   
  
People accuse others of being on gear as an excuse for their shortcomings. When in reality if they put in the time, effort, and dedication they could see the progress they write off as ""someone being on gear."""

"It's all good man. The fitness journey is full of plateaus and these games your body and mind play on you. The more times you go through it, the easier it will be to deal with it and realize it for what it is. It's important to stay focused and stay consistent. If you're having a bad week, nothing wrong with deloading. Sometimes it helps your CNS recover a bit more if you've been going hard AF and you'll come back stronger. 

Is it possible it's because you're cutting? Maybe but I doubt it at that bf unless you're really starving yourself. Also, depending on what you eat before a workout can make a huge difference in your strength for the workout. I find I have the most strength when I have something like a sweet potato and a simple sugar a couple of hours before the gym. 

At the end, just stay consistent and don't lose hope. Know that it's a phase and you'll be back to making gainz in no time!"
Nothing. I'm fucking losing my shit.

It's the equivalent of popping a vitamin and some Gatorade. I would certainly not be drinking empty calories post-workout while cutting.
"Yeah i am drinking a lot of water rn anyway just that i notice whenever i don‚Äôt drink much and eat sth I end up w massive water retention.

I am gonna try drink as much water as I can and then piss it all out dehydrating the shit out of myself. 

Also i don‚Äôt even need a peak-week w the shape and I got and seeing the competition yet I got great dudes here at my gym who teach me how to.

I also think peaking as a natural is hard but lol w my current shape i would only need to focus on being as lean as i can."

"Wow that's hard buddy. Not up to that extent but have been in a pretty toxic relationship where I gave up too many things I shouldn't have, need to set boundaries ASAP, know your priorities and what you're willing to give up or adapt for the relationship and what not. If done in time it should be manageable but once the other person has gotten used to certain things it can be way harder, since they take it for granted.

In your case you probably need to evaluate the situation and decide how you want to live that relationship if you want to continue it, and start making changes towards that. May generate conflicts but if you don't change that it'll keep getting worse. It sounds as if she has too much dependency and that is leading to both of you having no personal space which is 100% necessary IMO.

Good luck buddy, and don't hesitate putting yourself first, a relationship won't work if we are constantly sacrificing things we don't really want to sacrifice."

"I've been feeling sore all over my body this week. I've been training more or less consistently this year. 

This week, I'm feeling sore in all my muscles but especially my shoulders, upper back and legs. When I hit a muscle , 4 days after hitting it last time (I run a PPL routine), I feel the soreness in it, like it hasn't recovered. It affects my strength and rep range (like the feeling at the end of the workout). 

I want to know what's wrong. I haven't done anything different this week to the previous ones, my routine, diet and sleeping are more or less the same. 

Has anybody experienced that before? What could be going wrong?"
Why is his pecker pointing straight up? Because he's number one?
I really thought it was gonna be nasty but I think it‚Äôs pretty good. It tastes like very lean ground beef to me but not as dry. I think it‚Äôs important to prepare it right and use good spices. I soak it in chicken or beef broth and then mix it with taco seasoning and follow the directions on the packet. Then I throw it in a burrito with cheese.
"Cutting formula: 1.4 x bw = protein, 1.4 x bw (-100) = carbs (mon-thur, fri &amp; sat is 50-75g carbs only). Sun = refeed day, if i lost 2 to 4lbs that week, carbs is 2 x bw. Fats = .25 x bw. On low carb days, .35 x bw 
Normal maintenance is bw x 40% for pro and carbs. Bw x 20% for fat. 

Bulk is diff. 1.4 x bw = pro, 2-2.75 √ó bw for carbs (slowly increasing each week) and .25 x bw for fat."
"Just because someone wins a year, doesn't mean anything for the next year, especially with someone like Ramy who has actually only nailed his perfect package once out of 9+ years competing...

"So basically you're saying slowly cut off the adex (arimidex) as fast as possible and IF necessary consider it as post cycle to avoid rebound &amp; not ON cycle - that's what was afraid of, in fact.
Cardio is 20 mins twice a week (40 min total), but p.t. thinks if I want to lose the weight I mentioned and be this super ripped fastly I might have to enhance it and drink ONLY once a week - basically he said tren is a great metabolism enhancer and 20mg is a nice dosage for women but alcohol is the devil, you can consider drinking only on your cheat day and can not be like ""ok I work out well I am on tren I can drink"" cause while your muscle will still grow you are not going to lose all this water weight. (exactly what you said)"
"Yeah they added role queue because otherwise people were just getting games of 5 DPS and maybe 1 tank or support lol. There's still open queue for comp and quick play classic in arcade which is how it used to be. Hasn't been dead for me tbh, heard all of its regions and consoles/pc still has a solid playerbase, if you haven't played in a while it might just be struggling to know who to put you up against. Or if you tried playing DPS in role queue that takes ages because that's what everyone queues up as, so it takes a while to find people playing tank/support. 

In the arcade section you can play mystery heroes which is really chilled and a lot of fun. Basically it picks a random hero for you to play, and then every time you die it switches to a different random hero."

"Thank you for the feedback!

As far as peak conditioning, I‚Äôd say yes and no - my prep was a bit thrown off when the competition was rescheduled and 8 more weeks were added right before peak week. My coach and I decided to pull back cardio for a few weeks  and up my diet to avoid me losing any muscle, and then returning to the same training and diet intensity level about 4 weeks out of the new date. So I think post-reschedule was a weird rebalancing period that may have caused me to not come in as hard as planned - but I gave my all during the last few weeks and was feeling good!

Definitely taking that feedback for next time, I appreciate you sharing it!"

Is bodybuilding a hard sport?
"ill post some old pics soon cuz if i post current pics ill get cussed for being small but if its old i can say im bigger, so you'll get to see them soon ;)"
It was much less depressing back then
That is insanity
Like if the gym is super packed I don't get why people think it's cool to fucking hog the leg extension machine lat pulldown and shoulder press at the same time. Then have the audacity to tell you they were using that and they have a few more sets. Those set are inevitably 30 minutes worth of sets.
No. Stick with regular shoulder presses unless you want to damage your rotator cuff as you progress in weight.
Haha I understand I'm just joking about how BB competitions have anemic prizes
Honestly the best thing I did for my sleep was get an adjustable bed base. When I was over 220 bodyweight I was having really bad sleep apnea and snoring.

"Diet wise, my advice is (if you can), literally eat the same thing every day. It's boring, but it keeps me eating healthy and hitting my macros. Then force yourself to go to the gym. I go every day, but that's because I found I can handle it. At first, it felt like a chore and motivation was hard to muster up. But then, I started to notice the gains. I've never had big Biceps in my life, and seeing actual size is one of the best feelings ever. So now I'm excited to go to the gym every day, and I look forward to when I can get my bf% down to the point that I can actually see the definition along with the gained mass haha. Just gotta figure out what pushes you forward brother"

Even something as simple as having a job can help. Did you guys always share work stories and anecdotes? Of course working from home will kill that. More importantly, when you guys were apart during the day because of work, did that make the time together just that much better?

Start there, figure out what's up before immediately thinking it's the relationship itself."

I could definitely see how that would happen. I‚Äôm still early enough in the stages of it where I‚Äôm still kind of thinking in macros.

Everyone can look good if hes training and eating good. The genetic potential is measurable and matter only on stage.
Pretty sure it can. I don't think they get rid of all the tissue. If you abuse PEDs and fuck up it will come back.

Probably a good idea
What‚Äôs your fave Pure flavor? Mine is lemon but no one ever agrees with me

"It‚Äôs free marketing. 

I used to train at Beyond Limits in Columbus, Ohio, and this reminds me of Arnold Weekend. Although I will say the folks shooting/filming there were generally very respectful, but a lot of that crowd was of the PL variety. So I feel like they ‚Äúget it‚Äù more than the BB folks."
"Mannn feels good to do anything active after a week off the gym.

Saturday had my birthday golf round with cousins, uncles, and friends.  Everyone was surprised I decided to walk the course, especially since the cart was included in the green fee, but I had been eating like shit all week and wanted to walk off all the bloat.  Probably the toughest course I've walked.  Hilly and long walks between each hole.  This got me ready to get back in the gym this week.

Yesterday, picked back up where I left off on Gamma, and man my back felt it yesterday and feels good sore today.  Also, I can't express my love for versa gripps.  Felt that pull session all in my back and none in my forearms and biceps."
Kegels are good. But IIRC BB's partner was extra wet vs extra loose.
You look great. Well done
I can promise you I‚Äôm not gay. I never get hard when I suck dudes off.
I've always been interested in a multigrip bar
Sheesh I‚Äôm dumb lol
Looking amazing good luck
Yes sir.
"Don't get me wrong. I love diversity and the fact that genetics have different advantages and disadvantages. I thought I made that clear. Bodybuilding isnt a physically competitive sport. And any race has potential in building muscles and becoming big, my problem is solely the fact we base the standard to a specific group. It has nothing to do with advantages. Black people don't have specific advantages in building muscle as whites or Asians do, it's purely the way it randomly went. It's not that black people are better lifters or anything. Actually Asians and whites have a clear advantage at that point but from a bodybuilding standpoint that shouldn't matter and it doesn't. But then I ask again. Why are black people favored in bodybuilding when there shouldn't be a racial advantage in these competitions. And again as I said. I have no problem if bodybuilding was a physically active competition but it just isn't and can't be compared to other sports like the ones you are mentioning"
More annoying than ego lifting? Leaving weights unracked? Curling in a squat rack? Grunting loudly while moving light weight?
Better refresh your knowledge chief.  I didn't even start puberty until 15 and grew most of that 11 inches at age 17. I imagine OP's doctor looked at growth plates before giving a prescription for growth hormone.
Good luck and best wishes...

My friends want to set me up with this cute mixed girl (my ultimate weakness) in a couple days. Time to go hard as fuck in the gym and Muay Thai to look extra swole. Probably will mess it up but thats why we're all in here.
Good looks. I think my non-lifting physical activity will be limited to baseball and whatever rec. stuff my friends want to do in that case. probably mostly basketball. Thanks
"I'm kind of stuck in the same debate the other guy is having.  If I had to choose between only drinking alcohol in moderation versus never touching alcohol most days and binging (8-14 drinks) every 2-4 weeks, I'd much rather prefer the latter.  I don't really know how much damage alcohol can do to one's gains when talking about an extra 1000-1500 calories every 2+ weeks, especially if combined with calorie counting.  Like is it really holding me back a lot or does it only start to matter at an elite level?"

"Tiktok spreads too much misinformation for any of the kids to get anywhere, some influencers are actually decent sources of info, but they're usually drowned out by gymbros who practically sweat tren.

The amount of teenagers I can spot on gear has exponentially increased in the past five years and it's going to kill them too early to make the sport any different, next to none of those kids will go pro, and the ones that do will be dead by 30 or fucked up into oblivion  with the amount of weird shit they're blasting.

Besides that, they're on some new age shit too, when I was in the locker room of my old gym I heard a maybe 5'8 150-160 kid talking about a tren and superdrol cycle he heard about on tiktok, he talked about it like it was 1000x more effective than test, deca, var, etc all combined, and that it would give him everything he could ever ask for, and his friends were absolutely down for it.

They're all gonna end up dead or needing valve replacements at 25, at the same time, new era could create some absolute maniacs for the sport, seems like the kids now will risk it all just to get a bit more definition

Edit: I went off on a little tangent and forgot to answer the question, yeah the definition is gonna change, dickskin is what people see as shredded I think, any more is considered to be ""dad bods"""
I‚Äôve never played. It‚Äôs an rpg yeah?

"Yeah, don't do exercises that hurt your shoulder or you will end up with a muscle tear.

Didn't adjust my sleep posture.

You won't be making gains when having so much inflammation so just be careful and try to maintain what you have. Eat anti inflammatory (omega 3, turmeric,...), drink enough water and keep doing your mobility exercises (nagging pain after an exercise is not good cause that's an indication of structural damage).

It's really important that your thoracic and shoulder mobility is optimal cause the more mobility a structure had, the better the blood flow will be (and the biomechanics/healing).

I'd advise to see an osteopath to see whether your cervical spine moves correctly cause that could also cause shoulder problems.

Good luck!"
And Arnold would say the same thing. Great advice!
Do it and don‚Äôt listen to haters
Haha. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and 90 so I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs possible. I have been told 100 is unlikely without drugs but he didn‚Äôt look insanely dry / cut to me. Also it‚Äôs 97.5kg
I'm pretty sure half this sub are 20 year olds who don't realize that.
"Anyone got experiences with MK-677 to share? I've been testing it for 2 months straight and felt very strong and more veiny than usual, but I didn't get more appetite as everybody was telling me."

Okay. How does one buy zinc sulfate? Just a pill or powder?

I got zero cardio gains but a shit load of water retention and bloating.
"Yeah I‚Äôm mean they are technically PEDs but nobody gives a shit I would easily bet every pro athlete in every sport (and I‚Äôm including curling) has used creatine. It just has no drawbacks, I mean some of these things like teen are illegal in some sports for a reason but creatine is like protein powder."
I agree entirely. I went HAM to get it for my mom when we first got it here but because I need to talk to my doc first I‚Äôm apparently ‚Äúanti-science‚Äù and ‚Äúenabling fascism.‚Äù According to like 10 yuppies at least but I‚Äôm really worried about how common shit like this is getting here. Rabid ideology of this order is a hell of a drug and I want nothing to with it.
"The thing that‚Äôs always weird about bodybuilders is if you look at just there face. It‚Äôs a normal persons face, they don‚Äôt have a ripped face."

"He‚Äôs the 2x MP Olympia champion, so I think his comment on crossing over to classic is more than likely just a joke/tease. It wouldn‚Äôt make much sense for him to cross over to a division where he would be much worse off, unless he was just doing it for fun after he was through with the Olympia"
"Yes! They could put the camera on a tripod and zoom so it captures the entire stage and literally let it run unattended. With 4K video becoming widely available even on smartphones, not to mention 8K on professional cameras, even by zooming in later in post production you would still have more than enough detail to pick and choose what parts you want to emphasize, without losing the big picture."
Nah

I I love your story and I'm glad you shared it here.
It's time to die!
Ok sure but there‚Äôs a difference between using pull-ups/dips/lunges in a standard BBing routine and the kind of high rep bodyweight only circuits OP is talking about. If you just did pull ups you‚Äôd look like shit
"Ah okay, thanks for the advice bro. I'll go for isolate then"
Amazing answer
Glad you like the sound of it! DMed the recipe
"This is my personal bias towards these games, but I always recommend Fallout New Vegas, Mass Effect series, and dragon age origins. Those games set the foundation for my love of RPGs."
"What are the benefits of living outside, from a bodybuilder perspective"
"It's mostly like ""do this body weight workout for gains!"" 

or

""start working out to cure your mental illness, haha, you dont need medicine!""

You can have an amazing physique with just bodyweight, but doing gymnastics or military style training and not doing the banded bodyweight squats these girls are talking about. 

The mental health aspect is so dumb. It's very prevalent. I saw a therapist, ate correctly, weight trained, for years did everything correct and things never got better until I got on SSRI anti anxiety medication. If you're sick, go see a doctor, not an influencer. This mentality to cure mental anguish with weight training or alternatives to medicine is prevalent in the fitness industry, self help industry, and protestant church culture. It's fucked up."
like a damn science experiment
its easy eat lots of protein and lift. at that hieght/weight ratio it should be easy to begin with. DONT EAT FAST FOOD. Cook your meals. LIFT WEIGHTS
Very interesting
"What the fuck, this guy looks like a 3D rendering"
This is going to sound pretty pathetic- I‚Äôm back at my parents for a weekend to help out with some projects. Spent about 3 hours weedeating yesterday and today is tearing down and rebuilding a wellhouse. I‚Äôm already fucking sore and beat. Manual labor hits different when you work a desk job and rent an apartment that‚Äôs for sure. At least I‚Äôm ‚Äúusing my muscles functionally‚Äù and getting a tan.
Who wouldnt? :D
What weight do you usually use for the dumbbells?
"Yes I have but haven‚Äôt done it in a while‚Ä¶ thanks for the reminder, imma reintroduce it"
Honestly I think the issue here is a couple of police officers with 'little man syndrome' they have a big guy in cuffs so thats the time to get a sly knee or jab in. A lot of people like this go into policing because they have some sort superiority complex.
"He's made some progress, but like you said he needs a lot more, he still has basically non-existent calves."
Saturday is the best day at the gym. Nobody else here and it‚Äôs push day babbbyyyy!
Well my first question is how the fuck wouldn't a person wake up when someone is ramming full fucking onions and garlic up your ass...my second question is can I watch
Nothing reminds me of how stupid I used to look in the gym like dyel teenagers strutting around and flexing in the mirrors with their barely defined muscles.
"Wish you good fortune , keep us updated! And yes you look pretty much done except the body parts u mentioned , there is still much potential left in glutes &amp; lower back.

"Yes, but she looks like my brother's cat (which I REFUSE to call my ""nephew""), and he's super violent, so I'm doing some prejudicing right now."

"Goosebumps. My normie friends who knew the song from League of Legends but don't know a thing about BBing actually *enjoyed* it, that should tell you a lot.

[Link to the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEZIYGN5HIo), it's a cover of a song Imagine Dragons made for a LoL World Championship"
Exactly. Thank you for the info
Lol imagine picking up heavy objects in a building for 2+ hours to escape the  p a i n  in life. Lol what losers. Totally can‚Äôt relate ...
"Looks like you could have fun in a boardshorts comp. Not because your legs are small or anything you look fine. 

The other person said you‚Äôll never be ready enough or big enough. I agree, just go ahead and compete in whatever you want and see what feedback you get, see what the other guys come looking like, and you‚Äôll learn what to do next time or if you even liked competing or if it‚Äôs worth it since you don‚Äôt plan on using anything. 

Have fun. I‚Äôll never be as big as you, so you beat one guy already."
"Short answer. Yes. 

Everyone is different, but with the body doing so much recovery while you sleep, most likely you are suffering a bit there and with your testosterone levels."
Thanks man!
frozen berries? or fresh if you're made of money
I have a friend that trained for 5-6 months and he flat out said i want to look like the guys on instagram and i told him again and again look its not that its 1 cycle away from you (and it doesn‚Äôt help that the guy that was selling it to him gave him tren with no test base or pct or anything for 12 weeks) like even now there are times that i feel sad for him . Thankfully he‚Äôs perfectly healthy now
"Holy shit dude you're just now on week 4? Meaning you've been taking 1mg of adex/wk despite only being in week 2 or week 3 of your cycle? That's *terrible*.

Test cyp and test e take weeks to fully saturate, like 6+ weeks. You were taking an AI before the test even really started working it's magic (and aromatizing afterwards). Your e2 has got to be tanked man, ditch the adex and go get bloodwork asap."
Thanks babe
Thanks man
Good stuff! Side note: Why all these research jobs outside the US...damn.
True but we don‚Äôt know what goes on behind closed doors. My family thinks I‚Äôm full of myself and overconfident in my body when I actually hate how I look.
"My best friend passed at 23 a week out for a show. Enlarged hearts don't show up in bloodwork, but they do show up in autopsies. They also did him dirty and noted the shrunken testicles as the last thing in the autopsy"

I love not having to pretend to work at home
Thanks for inspiring me and being the voice of strength and tenacity when my own wasn't enough. I'm glad you were born.
Is this another pacjax clone? Getting banned from the sub really made that guy go insane. I saw him posting again the other day under new AAA accounts. So strange.
Body weight exercises for you my friend
"Usually tears happen when you're elongating the muscle, not when shortening it. Bodybuilders are all pretty damn strong so even though your muscles are trained enough to lift a certain weight you're still pushing what the human body is capable of.

Plenty of bicep tears happen while deadlifting. People will incorrectly engage their biceps to pull on the usually large amount of weight. With arms extended your biceps are completely elongated putting a ton of stress on the muscle and tendon. A clean muscle tear is the tendon tearing from the bone. Partial tears are usually the muscle itself  Cheat curls are another big one.

Then again you can have it happen with dumbbells as well though that's usually a much lower weight compared to something like a deadlift."
"A healthy dose of squats and deadlifts won‚Äôt hurt. Will help fill out your legs/low back. chest could use work also. 
Upper back and arms looking good though for sure."
What‚Äôs the worst that could happen? Worried about conflict or just trying to be polite and not fuck a mans fresh ex in his home?
You're welcome.
"Maybe try r/brogress, this is for competitive bodybuilding"
"Forget Instagram, everyone is now onlyfans famous"
"Do you also get excited at the prospect of;

Thank you! I appreciate the kind words.
"It's awkward at first, yeah, but you get used to it. Looks kinda cool too."

"Bumstead being arrested for drug importing.

Ooooooo drama drama"
This was a set up and you fell for it nicely
"Thanks a lot, 183 cm (6 ft)"
"It depends, but generally I'd avoid this. Deadlifts are very physically and mentally draining, at least when they're reasonably close to failure, and doing high reps would further compound this.

Good mornings, RDLs, hip thrusts and hang pulls would be more recoverable, and have similar patterns of muscle recruitment. They would be much more suitable for high reps, IMO."
"The last week of bulking is weird.  Here I am getting dinner at Olive Garden, drinking 5 beers on a Monday, all while fantasizing about how awesome it'll be when I'm shredded in 12 weeks."

Love using the Hammer Strength [Squat Lunge](https://www.lifefitness.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Squat-Lunge-PL.jpg) machine for split squats. It stabilises you laterally without allowing you to use your arms to pull up (as would be the case if you're holding the side of a rack).
squats lol
"some people turn into an unwanted coach whenever you ask for a spot. just takes some time to find the right people in the gym you go to, who would spot properly and then just continue their workout."

"The lats seem to be a lagging body part for sure, I feel like my arms could use a few inches on them too to get more classic üò§üëÄ"
Yeah so many people like us.  I remember when I first ever started training.  My best mate was a pt.  he couldn‚Äôt believe how much I was affected by the scales.  Said I was worse than any female client so he stopped weighing me.  When I worked in gym all the guys and owners wanted me to compete.  Not in a million years would of been able to
Look f-Ing good but I think your right arm is much bigger than your left
"What are some of your favorite diet staples that doesn't include the normal meat, rice/potatoes, veggies combo?"

Thank you so much for your advice
"I agree with you. If I do the motion unweighted, I literally cannot get into a position that would have the bar resting on my clavicles. Not because of a lack of mobility, but physiology. Either my humerus would have to be longer, or my forearm shorter, because at the very bottom position, if my forearm is vertical, then my hand is higher than my shoulder. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, full range of motion is bar under chin. This may vary based on individual proportions."
"Oh don‚Äôt worry that was me just fucking around haha some douche decided to shit on me on things I don‚Äôt think are a weakpoint so I threw all that in there tongue in cheek.

Making a compilation of your progress through camera roll slideshows is so god damn motivating. I made one for fun this morning and actually got hyped watching my progress through the years. Almost went and attempted a bench PR after.
"Damn, dude. Fucking nice work. Goes to show what you can do with some hard ass work"
No one is going to read it.... but they did read it. So you‚Äôre wrong. I know I‚Äôm not doing enough for my legs.  I‚Äôm clearly here asking for advice because I want to do better.

"Yeah i think he's cracked the code. Right now he's just gonna one-up himself for the next Olympia. I could imagine we'll be seeing alot of Ramy for a good while, hopefully."
"Yeah, I can see the logic behind that. And having shoulders on push day it's hard to go crazy on chest and still see progress on delts inside of the same session imo."
"My forearms are normally fine, they are just getting pumped as shit every time I do pulls of any kind as the gyms just opened two weeks ago and they aren't used to being worked like this. Both deadlifts, barbell rows and even romanian deadlifts are completely a-okay for me. There is just something about doing a wide-grip pulldown that just fills my body with dread. Everything else is fun, or feels great to grind through, but lat pulldowns? Just kill me.  


EDIT: My DL max is is 160kg with chalkless over/undergrip, and I do both over- and undergrip rows of 135lbs+, so my grip strength is fine also."

"No one is saying you can't talk to people &amp; there's more ways to socialize besides a bar &amp; club. Besides, the eyes &amp; body language are what really put forth your intentions &amp; energy; speaking in a calm &amp; friendly tone will really help you socialize much more than you think. I studied this like a mf bc I'm terrible at communicating, &amp; my gf has a psych degree so I made sure I'm not just doing things.

Yes venue limits suck &amp; are gonna limit social networking but it's not that hard to be friendly &amp; social with something covering your mouth."
Lol underrated
"The best way to adapt to the cold so you don‚Äôt have the adverse shaking/shock reaction is practice with hot to cool or just cool first, then progress to hot/cold or cold. I do contrast(really hot to freezing cold) or just cold to recover, sucked at first but now I look forward to them. Also do sauna to freezing shower at my gym sometimes."
"make sure to keep us posted man, id be really curious to see how your shows go! your posing doesnt look horrible, but im sure youve got a posing coach by now to help out ya?"

My max is 500lbs for 3 reps, would you say I need less than maximal bracing for the 4x10 245? Don‚Äôt wanna fuck up my back 

How many seconds (or breaths) would you suggest to take between each rep?"
My fat intake is really low. I find it easier to create a caloric deficit if i lower my fat intake. And when im deep in a cut i mainly crave carbs

That being said, the piriformis is located under your mid/upper glute. A bigger piriformis will make a bigger upper glute visually, even if it is a separate muscle technically. A bigger butt is the goal, so it was not misinformation so much as misinterpreted information.

To counter Paul Carter's thoughts, Brett Contreras is a big proponent of banded glute work, and he knows his stuff where building butts is related.

I like my banded hip thrusts and I have what I consider to be a decent ass, so I'm gonna keep at it. Again, just try new things and see what works for you!"

Yes. I‚Äôm taking so many stimulants I might die. I have been getting a refeed every 3-4 weeks or so. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where they just speed things up enough to make me drop weight faster. I lost 4lbs in the last week and I did get a refeed of sushi. It‚Äôs been pretty nutty but I‚Äôm looking forward to being done with everything after next weekend.
What the hell kind of job is that lmao
How many times do you eat lol. 900 calories is crazy.
"Like you said earlier, anyone can do a short term study and see no side effects, it‚Äôs the long term stuff that can be dangerous, and when a vaccine hasn‚Äôt been out very long, it‚Äôs kinda worrying.

In that case, I feel like your referring to a large amount of African Americans as that, considering minorities are the least vaccinated."
Good luck dude!

Delts and upper body looks great. Mid back could use some work legs look solid but need a lot more size lats are wide chest is good. You‚Äôll smash it man keep going

I don‚Äôt think it would speed up muscle growth but it might make you less sore. I know some people have had good luck with feeder workouts and this is sort of similar? Might as well try but be very careful to not cut into recovery.
I got SIGNIFICANTLY better results taking an approach of working up to one top set to failure and a back off set to failure

2. 8 Reps by 8"

"Finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone into the more potent DHT. By blocking this conversion, finasteride prevents male pattern baldness / hair loss. The chances of side effects are seemingly quite low. But having done a lot of research, tho finasteride would help me (balding rapidly in my early 20s and it‚Äôs ruining my life), the potential side effects outweigh the benefits. Firstly, finasteride was originally used for prostate related conditions. 5mg finasteride (Proscar) reduces the size of the prostate. 1mg Finasteride (typical dosage for hair loss) is not as high of a dose but if I‚Äôm not mistaken still decreases the size of the prostate. I personally think we don‚Äôt have enough of an understanding to know how changing the size of such an important organ affects the rest of the body (complex systems where everything is interconnected). Furthermore, finasteride can cause ball ache, weaker erections, watery semen, loss of libido, and even changes to sperm DNA in many men. Most of these side effects are temporary and will stop when you stop taking finasteride but for a considerable amount of unlucky people, they‚Äôve persisted for up to 5 years after discontinuing treatment and sometimes indefinitely. There‚Äôs increasing evidence of this, referred to as ‚Äúpost finasteride system‚Äù. There‚Äôs not many double blind peer reviewed studies etc but absence of evidence doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean evidence of absence. Given all of these, plus my general risk management principles (not taking anything that we don‚Äôt understand fully &amp; affects complex systems [hormones/organ function etc]), I personally wouldn‚Äôt risk it. The chances of something going wrong are small but the impact is very high.

Personally if I were you I‚Äôd look into using minoxidil 5% solution (Rogaine). And if you‚Äôd like, perhaps look into combining that with micro-needling. There‚Äôs growing evidence that when the two are used in combination, it‚Äôs multiple times more effective than just one of those alone. Will ink to an interesting study on it below. Minoxidil has far fewer side effects, certainly none relating to hormones etc. Risk with micro-needling is if you do it yourself at home, don‚Äôt sterilise properly, and give yourself a nasty infection. Minoxidil alone might be enough for you! I‚Äôd strongly strongly disagree with your doctor. Many doctors (respectfully) don‚Äôt know enough about finasteride and are a bit trigger happy with it. Good luck and lmk if you have any more questions!

I will finish the dozen by tonight for my full cheat day (with other healthier meals of course). Carb cycling rules. 

The pump in the gym was absolutely insane, and the glycogen rebound already filled me back out after slamming the donuts. This picture is about an hour and a half post workout. Being lean makes pumps so so much better."
"Sounds good man! A way to know it is doing AMRAP sets (as many reps as possible) in the exercises that allow it from time to time, so you know how the failure feels, and you can have a reference of how many reps you can get with a certain weight. The rest of the time you should aim to be something along 1-3 reps away from failure. 

Nonetheless, it sounds like you may be doing too much volume if you're training 6 day and with so many sets and exercises. You can train 6 days if you like it but it will be more productive not doing as many sets and focusing more in each one, you want to stimulate the muscle, not annihilate it. Doing something like 10-12 sets per week for big muscle groups and 8-10 for smaller ones is a good place to start."
You mean prolonging the cut?

Thanks for the advice. Diet has always been my problem and I have even able to stay this lean year round eating whatever fast foot and stuff I want. But I do need to change
"Why does Reddit have such a problem with personal accountability?
If you see an influencer lie and you follow their foot steps etc and are disappointed with the results that‚Äôs not anyone‚Äôs fault but the moron following a social media icon."
Lol true
Thanks man
You look exactly like the OG fitness guy Timbahwolf
You ‚Äúcan hear‚Äù whatever the fuck people say but it doesn‚Äôt make it true. The top guys are absolutely using tren and absolutely using higher doses than they admit.
Sick man. Can you go over what you were eating?
Hammer curls on the preacher bench are good too.
What‚Äôs up you glorious heaps of mass. Made a new account after stepping away from Reddit. Now when I try to comment in subs I need damn permission - I‚Äôm humbly asking for ~50 karma.

"I disagree. There‚Äôs more muscle gain at work than the gym. The gym is a casual place where you just workout for 30 seconds than rest for 10 mins. At work, you need to workout more intense and constant than at the gym. That forces ur mind and body to adapt to harsher situations, forcing your body to produce more muscle (this is called getting used to the job). Eating is overrated. Just eat enough. Recovery is the most important."
I like ya cut G
Lookin great dude.  That‚Äôs a good weight to be that lean at. And at 19 that‚Äôs quite the accomplishment. Keep it up!
"It doesn't matter. It's literally the one thing you can't control, compare your execution and results to others and you'll see but what the fuck do people expect to happen? Will you quit if someone says you have bad genetics? If so, quit anyway, you're gunna need more mental strength or motivation than that. 

Some of the Goats didn't look like anything special to begin with or before juice, there are 100 other factors that go Into bodybuilding successfully, ignore genetics as it can ONLY ever be used as an excuse, and excuses don't belong in this sport."
"With such strong muscles, it's a pity not to move bricks"
Awesome thanks man. Any pre-written programs you suggest or something I should look up online? I'm typically in the gym for around two hours so time isn't really an issue. Just tryna get big lol

"&gt;Who cares if they're wearing masks, dude? Why do you care?

I literally answered that at the end of my comment bro. I don't care if you wear a mask, I care if you are affecting policy. When the CDC came out and said that masks are not necessary anymore, the San Francisco mayor announced on twitter that they would lift in door masks requirements, this group of people pounced and the mayor immediately backpedaedl. 

So it's no longer a ""you do you"" thing if the CDC is telling you you don't have to wear a mask and you're screaming at officials to force people to wear one, against CDC guidelines."

My girlfriend's sister is a Q nut, and she flipped out when COVID was first reported. Back when no one took it seriously (not even me). She called my girlfriend, crying, begging us to come stay with her in her rural town because she thought the world was ending.

Then when more information came out about it, all the sudden it's a hoax. When she was forced to wear a mask, her nose was always sticking out. She refuses to get vaxxed.

I love escaping to fantasy worlds too, but I know it's fantasy."

"Hard work is implied. Whenever somebody says something like that they just mean if a natural with average genetics puts in hard work they wont get those same results. The original guy asked how do you get those traps? Obviously hes basically saying ‚Äúive worked out hard but dont have those traps so how does he have those traps?‚Äù The other guy replied the difference is genetics and steroids.

Dont take it so personally when somebody says that. No one is saying it doesn‚Äôt take hardwork. Of course it does. Its kind of a given."

"I'm not sure what the actual reaction is that provides that general feeling of wellbeing, I'm inclined to think it's more than placebo. Ive been taking 100mg ed for close to a year. That's a long time for placebo, also when I started, I started because I half read a study saying it boosted test, and just figured I'd try it out. I didn't even expect to feel better in general from it. 

Iirc, it has a larger impact on estrogen than test in males, and perhaps the slightly elevated estrogen in a natty = general feeling good. 

Idk I'm not going to pretend to understand, but the research I've seen suggests there's no harm in it, and a lot of potential (although perhaps marginal) benefits. So I figure one more capsule in my morning routine is not a big deal"

"Lol I meant psychoactive drugs, theres a flaw at least in your deadlift logic, it's the amount you lift and also the angle you lift it at, meaning if you weighed 1000 pounds and did the motion of a deadlift it would be far easier than the force exerted when lifting 700-800 pounds on a deadlift as you're back extends and you lift the weight at an angle extended at the end of a body part, like a bicep curl, imagine if you strapped a dumbell to the end of your forearm? Curls would be 90% easier and less effective, it's not just about the weight it's also about the position of the weight in relation to the muscles contracting and the joints working at the time"

Yeah my doc gave them to me when I pulled my back too and it helped keep me from further injuring myself but they don't really do anything as far as treatment goes.

"I write down most of my lifts in a fitness journal, and mainly use it to look back to see what weight/reps I did for a specific lift. I like knowing how much weight to add, or how many more reps to do, prior to starting a lift. I'd say it's been pretty beneficial for me to consistently progress by adding weight to the bar/do more reps with the same weight."
"where the fuck did i say anything about gear? my dude, a proper bulk doesnt mean get fat or use gear. it just means eating enough food to actually make a difference. people who say shit like maingaining and lean bulking are 99% of the time people scared of putting on a little fat so they do exactly what i said in my post above."
Have you done heroin? Definitely don't answer that if you don't want to but that's pretty key to the equation too
Nah the oil is in the rear delts. Also could be hyaluronic acid
3x10 of a bunch of bullshit and no weights listed
"This is super inspiring to me. I am going through about the same level of transformation and I am currently at about the 4th picture. It‚Äôs so nice to see roughly what I can get to if I just keep grinding. Looking great bro, kill it!"
"And legs in general.  Thankfully she made a comment about my back later, or else they'd be on the chopping block too."
"Well, he probably never has to shave the inside of his thighs."
Really starting to increase my reach on the abs wheel. Starting to engage the glutes/lower back when I hit my limit. (I know expect to be told I'm doing it wrong.)
"I've been inspired!  How did you come out of your shell?  I've been trying to work on going out solo and stuff like that, but it's very hard starting out."
Fantastic!
Better start cutting dude
His NFL work ethic will have him gain 25 pounds of LBM in the offseason
Unless you are absolutely serious and committed to your diet and training and to this lifestyle in general I would not recommend you touch steroids.
So rows give you big biceps? That makes no sense
"Shrugs, but with a wider grip. Arms out like 45¬∞ and focus on pulling inwards.

Add in some heavy pulling and I'm pretty sure that's near optimal. Also have loads of test."
No self promo‚Ä¶
"Also has vitamin D, way more omega 3s, and is better for the environment."
"Ah yeah. That'd do it. I don't have that many hours at work but similar situation and high workload this semester. I'm really glad I'm not the only one.

I'm getting better at doing college work though, today was productive in that regard for me and I'll try to drop work after Christmas. Although I complain a lot I think, I always wake up with the conscious intention to do my best even if sometimes I fuck it up badly. I'll do my best now that I have more perspective. Thanks for the advice."
"I do worry about my form, high bar squat usually, I worry about stabilising my back, hard to tell
I always have chest up, toes pointed out. not sure what else I can do to keep back straight.
I even practice body squats in mirror, glutes are quite large and look like they're bending away from my back if that makes sense"
"Going to hate this, but I wipe back to front. I‚Äôve done this my whole life Idk."
Thanks. I will try my best
"Thanks man, that helps."
I personally despise his personality but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a bad guy. He just comes across as very inauthentic and kind of tries too hard. Never came across as cocky to me though
"Lol, pretty new so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing out on something"
are you seriously this fucking retarded?
"damn no kidding, bloke needs to discover google instead of postion idiotic questions all day. fucking help vampire."
Will screw your kidneys. Look into caffeine and red ruby grapefruit alongside a super low dose anavar maybe
Yeah and it‚Äôs not even done yet it‚Äôs gonna be huge hahahaha
"Yeah, his mom shat him out just as he is now for sure. Probably never lifted a kilogram in his life."
Spent a stupid amount of time deciphering W4SKB. Been lifting for 3 years and working on learning form/basics. Pretty f‚Äôin pumped to start on Monday.
I'm being held to my word and I love it. I'll start practicing now!
Co worker asked if i stopped lifting since im looking so much smaller. Yepp cut is going great
Brother. Hope you drinking electrolytes today! Lol
He definitely didn‚Äôt. Lowering weight to improve technique for a bit is fine but you can‚Äôt just keep improving with the same weight.
"classic all day, super aesthetic physique man. Looking solid for 4-6 weeks out too. Hope u smash it!"
is /u/qwsdxcbjking alive?
Your natty pics are quite impressive alone.
His delts are nuts too. Seems to be lacking a bit on the leg department. I would like to see him in competition shape
You look amazing. If I had any criticism I'd say legs could be slightly bigger
"Honesty yeah l, super chill dude. I was like ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm ____ can we get a picture later‚Äù he was like ‚Äúoh for sure man, I‚Äôm Logan‚Äù I cut him off and was like ‚Äúman I know who you are‚Äù and he goes ‚Äúno I know but I feel like I need to introduce myself‚Äù. Great interaction."
"That‚Äôs partly why I‚Äôm impressed with this cream of rice, cooked in 90 seconds in the microwave."
Appreciate it!
"I stopped going to the gym 1 year ago so now im kind of skinny fat but with some muscle (more than average), im 18y/o with a kinda small frame, small hands and wrists but decently broad shoulders. Im currently 155pounds.

The question: I‚Äôve noticed i get stretchmarks reaaaally easily, im not big by any standards but my biceps are covered in stretchmarks. Yesterday i went to the gym for the first time in a 3months and did a VERY light push workout. Today i woke up with a stretchmark at my armpit/chest, is this possible? I didnt even get a good pump so, this has happened multiple times. Im very inconsistent at the gym so i dont know if i have good genetics to grow fast but is this an indicator or is it possible that i get stretchmarks from the pump?"
Interesting. I‚Äôve never thought of it that way. Seems extremely doable. Good luck my man!
"I‚Äôve worked really hard for the symmetry I have. I‚Äôve had tons of injuries over the years that caused atrophy in my right leg, left arm/shoulder/pec, lat, etc. And had to build it back up over time. I still have some improvements to make in my right quad/adductor/hamstring."
Save some carbs for an hour or so before bed.
No. He‚Äôs not as genetically gifted as others. He is very solid though.
Be the change you want to see
"Agreed, he looks insane. His structure is overpowering. I think he could still be a bit sharper, conditioning-wise but I think his structure still carries him to the win. 

Though if he was a bit more conditioned he would really slam the door on Shaun &amp; Kamal. I still think it‚Äôs not 100% though"
Keep it up! Good shit!
I mean‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs one cheat ‚Ä¶. Doesn‚Äôt count if you don‚Äôt enter it on mfp
I have a serious problem. All I want to do is bench. As we speak I‚Äôm trying to think of a way I could bench today (back day) even though I benched yesterday on leg day. I think I‚Äôve been infected with benchismybestlift-itis. My situation is dire and my elbows may not see next week.
Shoes or nah?
"If your puffy nipples are gyno, no, if body fat, yes but it‚Äôll be stubborn as someone who had moobs for a good decade.

Stretch marks also don‚Äôt go, but you‚Äôll learn to take pride in them.

You need to get lean lean to downplay the more extreme aspects of a physique such as stubborn body fat areas and aesthetic issues IME, but in the grand scheme of things they‚Äôll become way less important to you and a point of pride for where you‚Äôve come."
"Thats super odd, never heard of something like that. Tenporary blindness if his neck is straight? Damn."
"Because you can legally and safely get gear prescribed to you. It‚Äôs called TRT. No doctor outside of dodgy ‚Äúmen‚Äôs health‚Äù clinics would prescribe much more for you because these drugs do, in fact, have serious health consequences. And no, the United States is not the only country to have strict drug laws."
"I would recommend you try taking 300 to 400 milligrams of magnesium threonate, or bi glycinate, and 200 to 400 milligrams of theanine,

Vitamin C taken in the evening has a slight effect on lowering cortisol.

L-tryptophan can be a powerful sleep aid for some. It's a precurser to melatonin and some sleep better on it than melatonin. I recommend 0,5 a couple of weeks, 1 mg a couple of weeks, followed by a couple of weeks off. Toxicity is low in small dosages. Avoid big dosages."
"Fuck it, do it barefoot"
"that's probably the smart solution but I always want to have my upper body muscles be performed 2x a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

ideally I'd want every muscle to be worked twice a week but I just cant figure out a way to do it in 5 days! lol"
Nah it should be tight
"Watching better by the day (RIP Rich). 

I fucking love that Rich‚Äôs entire strategy to lose 70+ lbs was basically to just eat exactly how he did during bigger by the day. except now he does calves and vacuums every day lmao. 

Really wish I appreciated him more while he was here. These two video series are a straight gold mine of decent information, memes and genuine motivation haha."
"The fatter this cunt gets, the barbell has to travel less."
No offense to Iain but I think Nick beats him shot for shot overall (assuming conditioning is equal).
Dammit I just want to see what this thing looks like out of morbid curiosity
Thank you
"I mean idk if I‚Äôd call that cowardly. Keone is already one of the best in 212 and has potential to be a contender for the GOAT in due time. Guy‚Äôs like 40, why bother competing if you know you‚Äôre going to get pushed down anyway?"
"That‚Äôs what I read but 72g an hour feels like a heck ton
That‚Äôs 288 grams over 4hr. Yeesh"
"One day, I'll know how to hit a good lat spread. It's like I can spread them until I bring my hands against my body. Clearly, I'm not understanding how to do it still."
"In my opinion, the highlight was Ramon, from Brazil. It was his very first Olympia and his SECOND professional show. He placed 3rd. And got better legs than Cbum (side chest proves that)."
"I mean you roll of shame it into position, don't see why you can't send it back down. [I've done it with the bench only supporting my upper back for shits and giggles ](https://youtu.be/ga_BdZG3_I0)"
I smoke almost every night. It usually helps
"LMAO I only post progess pics when I finished a bulk/cut cycle, so they're infrequent. I was also wearing a cat-themed tank top when this happened üòÇ"
"No matter what you will get some trap Involvement. The glenohumeral and shoulder girdle joints work together synergistically, so if you‚Äôre abducting your arm, both will move. The key is to use a light enough weight that‚Äôs still challenging to make it to where larger movers don‚Äôt have to generate the force."
"RIP, dude made me go from a sad kunt to a sickkunt"
Well I sure didn‚Äôt need to know that existed‚Ä¶
"That's true for scalp hair but not facial hair.  Scalp hair is battling DHT and minox just stimulates it to grow in spite of that.  Facial hair doesn't have to battle DHT so once it goes terminal, it has no reason to go back unless there's a substantial testosterone reduction.

That's the theory at least.  I think in practice it's also related to the fact that beards get thicker as we age while scalp hairs get thinner, so minoxidil is basically just making your facial hair prematurely age, i.e. giving you facial hair you were always gonna have eventually.

There's so much broscience to hair, fuck."
Pretty damn good for only a year tbh
Thank you!
"The same could be said for 'who cares how freaky someone is, some people just want to look good'"
"Yeah, they can move people from the other shifts if they need extra people so I'm not too bothered, and I don't give a fuck about the company at all it's just the people I work directly with are all amazing so feel a lil bad leaving them in a shitty situation, but on the plus side they have a valid excuse for taking it a bit easy lol. 

&gt;‚ÄúNever catch feelings at work‚Äù

The two women I worked with were both absolutely gorgeous, wholesome angels! But ones moved country and the other is getting married so had to follow this rule lol. 

&gt;two week notice is still generous of you.

Only giving one week because that's all I have to give as stated in my contract, I'd have happily given way more but I'll need a few days to adjust to opposite sleep schedule and I only found out I've definitely got the new job a couple days ago so not really an option. 

Excited though, after a few years I'll be a proper electrical engineer, it's less hours, slightly more money, half day on Fridays, and *fucken day shift again!!!*"
Thanks a bunch
"Thank you for the advice, is there anything I can do to help prevent this from happening?"
bad nipple genetics üíîüíîüíîüíîüíî
Stop overcooking your dry ass chicken
Thank you!
I wonder what old man strength actually is. Maybe just better muscle recruitment because of a better mind-muscle connection?
I used to want big arms to fill out a tshirt. Now I just want teardrop quads to look good in my short shorts.
Sounds like something you should create. Good idea!
"like lmao man just go into that 440 cold and stop wasting time. 15 minutes is the time limit here, okay?"
Let them bro they can suck my balls cause they think downvoting me will change my opinion or make me think I‚Äôm wrong or something but I don‚Äôt give a shit I‚Äôll stay by this point until I die
"That‚Äôs not surprising I guess. I did not say that Tennyson looks bigger than him or anything like that. I said, as using Will Tennyson as a reference point, he seemed a little smaller to me."
Maybe you fatigued your front delts to hard with the db bench ?
"objectively wrong, of all the things to nitpick why would you choose one of his strong points lol"
What the fuck lol
Thank you so much
"Love the videos he has been uploading, no cringe music or motivational shit, just following the journey. Plus it's cool to see how Melissa and him go through the prep together."
"Who gives a shit, being short(er) in bodybuilding is an advantage. And i say this as a 5'10'' behemoth"
"Seriously?? ""Who knows""?! Wow, I don't want to be rude but I cannot believe that people who follow bodybuilding can look at this person who just won the fucking comp and be like ""Idk man, could be natty. You never know!"" Like, yes tf you should know. You know because he looks like that at 19."
Why would he want to bulk his stomach out. That‚Äôs literally the opposite of what every bodybuilder wants.
"I‚Äôm pretty tall w/ a big frame but never been a big eater. That‚Äôs def held me back. So now I‚Äôm eating about 3500 cals/day + shit load of protein and moderate carbs/fat. I‚Äôve cut out snacking and excessive sugar. Jumped from about 200 pounds to 215 and don‚Äôt seem any less lean. 

All that‚Äôs left is to cut drinking but that‚Äôs difficult as a college athlete since it‚Äôs the main social activity ya know? Thanks for asking homie."
"Many 90s bodybuilders had better confitioning than now. 
If we watch like todays mr olympia, upper tighs arent so tight than 90s.
Sorry my bad english"
Post a picture of your bad muscle insertions‚Ä¶
No lol.
it would be empty quickly. people here are too scared to post pics (which says something about their physiques usually) so theres no way theyll post them in a thread for all of us to rate.
the best combo. have you ever hit shoulders and back? that's a juicy workout too.
Thanks for the breakdown lol I am new... never said I wasn‚Äôtü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇüòÇ
Fixed. Yeah I don't think I nailed the rear glute spread but it did show off my absurd spinal erectors.
Thanks for the feedback!
"i get he is popular, but he is a mid tier amateur at best"
"Looks great, definitely see all your hard work! I‚Äôd definitely being up those legs to even out the look, also where‚Äôd you get all that neck from fam?"
"Bad English, scusi!"
That is sick dude. Home gym is a life goal of mine. The only question now is garage door up so the neighbors can see the gun show or door down for iron dungeon vibe

At least he survived and in recovery
"Feeling a little more confident lately so may as well share some [pics.](http://imgur.com/a/vxmsWYT)

I think the ones I do decently are FDB and side chest. I don't have a nice mirror to practice :("
Look sick. The good sick just to be clear
"That sounds good, less stress should help with the cut too so better times ahead!"
"You gotta do like 15 push-ups
BUT DON'T DO ANYMORE

you'll overtrain and that's bad"
Myfitnesspal is being a bastard and it usually takes around 6 attempts for it to load and open. I've just given up now. Alternative apps on android so I don't have to use this shit?
Gyno???? üòÇ bro you sound just like my insta followers. Natty since I started the gym @16/17
Yes sirüò§!
hahaha nope i dk ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just what he prescribed
"Agreed. For someone who‚Äôs been training as long as he has, his physique is nowhere near impossible to get. Definitely attainable naturally and definitely not because of his ‚Äúgreat genetics‚Äù"
"Oh cool they coined a new word for ‚Äúspinning your wheels‚Äù. I remember years ago Charles Loliquin say something to the effect of ‚Äúyou have one ass, pick a horse‚Äù."
"Gotcha, thanks bro!

&amp;#x200B;

When doing the single arm cable row for lats do you twist a bit or try to keep your body straight?"
"It‚Äôs insane how all of the best competed in their prime at the same time. If he was amongst the bodybuilders of today, he‚Äôd be untouched. No one would ever come close. He‚Äôd win every single Olympia he‚Äôd compete at. He could be 15x Mr Olympia lol"
"No problem, it may be difficult to do but I think it would make it far more popular.  Personally I don‚Äôt know more than 2-3 guys who workout enough that I could talk to them or follow them on this, but if it was just a message board for each gym I could see myself scrolling it and posting occasionally because then there‚Äôs a few dozen people who are on there and we all work out near each other."
Delusional. It‚Äôs like the real life version of Adam competing from Workaholics.
Swear I'd take last place in the orangutan division of BB if these phone pics on my shitty garage lighting are anything to go by
"You‚Äôre lucky you don‚Äôt have big hips and narrow shoulders that would be much worse

"I don""t know it'll be hard. If Ramy comes in conditioned brandon can't win. If Ramy comes in bad perhaps, but even then, Brandon is getting older and loads of the ""young"" ones show great potential."
"Lmao if you think substantially larger than this guy is small lmao you realize Chef Rush and Kali Muscle claim natty, right? It's all about being a nice and trustworthy person so everyone thinks ""Oh, yeah I guess he just has amazing genetics and a fantastic work ethic""

I'm accused of saucing daily. But I'm not going to fucking admit to it ü§£"
Felt stupid strong on my squats but after my second set my right hammy got stupid cramped. Worst feeling ever

"depends on your needs and goals.

Fish oil: year round for anyone not eating fatty fish

Magnesium: if deficient in diet

potassium: really recommend getting in diet, but if impossible, supplement

sodium: really shouldnt need, just salt meals.

calcium: if deficient in diet

chromium picolinate: great either bulking or cutting, not needed if doing keto

slow niacin: if lipids need help

vit C: if needed

"No not really. The shape of your ribcage is based on genetics but in the vacuum there's more to it. Samir Bannout is one of the people who's Vacuum looked like a V at one point in his career and a U at another point. You can't change the ribcage that much, but you can change your execution and practice it. Tomn8er made a video on the differentiate types of vacuums. Do check them out."

"no clue, best emulator you can find for breath of the wild is probably switch"
Are you fucking retarded or something?
Ok that makes more sense. Definitely feel more of a stretch on rdls than anything else so I'll just keep at it.
"Don't get me wrong, I've made great progress with them, but I would 100% be lying if I said they don't absolutely make the rest of my workout suffer, and doing then at the end of a hamstring day sounds like a nightmare for stability. I just am starting to think that for me specifically, I see no value in programming such a high energy demanding exercise unless my hamstrings or erectors became my weakest link."
"Thanks man I appreciate it. I was 170lbs one year ago, you got this!"
"As natty as piana was, loved his youtube content; RIP Piana!"

Call me crazy but watching 55kg women clean and jerk 300lbs tells me everything I need to know about whether they are juiced
"Not really and that's a problem I've brought up with her. Her goal when she started was to do a chinup and now she can do 2 or 3, but she doesn't have any goals past that so I think some of the excitement has disappeared. ""I don't want to get too big"" and ""I don't want to hurt myself trying to deadlift a thousand lbs"" type mentality, so like what goals could she even have"
"5 degrees difference is huge buddy. There are also other variables, objects weigh approx 0.5% more at the poles than at the equator. That is why I lift at the North Pole because I'm no bitch."
"Yeah, like another half-inch or something like that. It's tough to find the ""sweet spot"" (apparently, making a double chin and shaving at that second line works), but once you do, you instantly look like a Professional Man."
I‚Äôd also like to see him switch. Next to some of the top Classic guys out there right now coupled with how the judges seem to be leaning lately he doesn‚Äôt have a snowballs chance in hell of placing inside the top 3. CBum is just too dominant. But take those aesthetics and pack on 50lbs then he might get somewhere.
That‚Äôs a great question for a medical professional...
"I had this problem for a long time, too. Getting that activation can be hard, for me the biggest thing was lowering weight a ton and focusing on the squeeze. I can row a few plates but I‚Äôll get a better pump from slowing everything down and lifting with empty bar form. For lats especially I had a complete turnaround in width when i added in pullovers. Experiment but you‚Äôre on the right track in trying to focus on activation. Also don‚Äôt neglect foam rolling, myofascial release, massage, etc.. you may find a nice deep tissue massage or general soft tissue work on your back might help you open up your range a bit and feel better activation."
Pretty crazy delts on him which make his side shots and even his front lat spread look nutty. The high lat inserts are pretty unfortunate though and his quads and abductors seem to be lacking compared to everything else. Fantastic hamstring sweep too
"That‚Äôs great. Favorite genre? Movies?

"Is it really that difficult to have another small bite if that extra activity were to come up? 

If you end up at only maintenance at one day and hit the 175kcal only on average you'd still be better of with that approach, simply because you increase the amount of time you can gain muscle until you need to reduce calories for body composition."

"If you're 56, it's near certain your T levels are low. That said, don't expect miracles. Actual TRT won't give you results like that. The problem is that a lot of gym rats say ""TRT"" when they mean ""permanent mild Test blast""."

"Yup, different mods and I swear I thought something was said to be about ""potential"" too but I could be misremembering. Like I'm not lean but I have decent muscle mass on my frame so there's potential for more, especially if I got leaner."
"It's a good way to get good at doing compound exercised

  IF you're lucky it might make you look fairly muscular also, but I'd wager that for the vast majority that's not the case."
"Yep, easier to ask for forgiveness than permission."
The 90's had the perfect balance
That's an argument to have with the parent. Telling the kid that and telling them to tell their parent that has little chance of working.
Nah man he's right... It sucked and wasn't funny. Pack up your shit up and go home.
why do people want to do anything?
No problem! You'll have to type that address into your web browser
"I have never felt my chest sore after a chest day workout.

I am wondering is this normal? If I go in and only do a bunch of chest things like presses and things with cables I still don‚Äôt feel my chest sore. Sometimes I‚Äôll even feel more sore in my side shoulder/arms/back than my chest."
"Haha. Balkan humor isn‚Äôt funny.. but it means Fucking Turks and is used to blame any problem current or prior on something that had nothing to do with it, kinda like Thanks Obama"

"Fairly pleased with my fat powerlifter shape at \~5.5 weeks out from a powerlifting comp. 195cm, 123kg.

Hope you feel better than I did!
he retired and stopped taking PEDs for this very reason
You're clueless. The muscles literally don't work like that
Delts looking pretty defined. The all mighty delt lord himself More plates more dates would be envious. Keep up the hard work
I usually do it like that but that was all i had for now lol . Got any tips on how to let the light hit ur back ?
Looking awesome!  Best of luck to you.
2 time a weak more than enough
"I get that, have a nice evening"
"If you found it hard, then it was good. If it was easy, up the weight or up the reps until it is hard. 

Don‚Äôt compare your numbers to other people. Because somewhere in China there is a 12 year old girl warming up with your 1RM, so if you start worrying about what other people can do, or looking down on other people because they can‚Äôt lift what you can, it is a very slippery slope."
"You could just run the recommended test cycle once.

Though you won't only do one cycle."
Cool it on the leg volume dude are you trying to kill us?
"To be fair, is anyone who *may* have gotten sick from the gym going to want to be a snitch and report it, and risk getting the gym shut down? lol"
Ooh big sexy
"atta boyyyy enjoy it while it lasts youve earned it. and my dude your already there if not past me man, you look fucking great and those are some horribly bad resolution pics, dont be comin at me with HD pics ill feel even worse!"
Lmao
They don‚Äôt want to know the truth
"He clearly is. Not being smug, if you‚Äôre relatively new to BB might not have a trained eye but yeah‚Ä¶ bet the entire world he is on some form of HRT at least.

Edit just looked at the photo again, yeah he prob on diuretics too. Dude looked amazing lmfao"
"Trying to sidestep the hunger by sleeping through it, and it can sometimes take a bit to fall asleep that initial time. If I dosed first, might get hit with hunger and never fall asleep."

"Actually that is a great point i never tought of steroids as a multiplier, so quick question not sure how much knowledge of roids you have but, what roids do people use on a bulk and what on a cut?"
In how much time did you gain that amount of weight? Seems like you dirty bulked?
Thanks this have cheered me up
"oh shit, I didn't even realize it was.  Nope, I'm checkin it out"
"In that trough between the feel good high of starting fluoxetine and then it actually kicking in and leveling out. Just a few more days hopefully.

Had a pretty good workout despite mental state. Keeping the picture small, baby steps, thoughts aren't facts."
Figure and you look great btw
Pork tenderloin has just as much flavor if not more than chicken breast. Plus they are basically identical nutritionally as far as I can tell so it's an easy substitution. I never reheat it though
"That's fair and I agree, I'll  probably just insert that type of direct work after traditional rows for max traps exhaustion"
"I see what you‚Äôre saying lmao. Guess it doesn‚Äôt matter, just was wondering why you‚Äôd be pulling water at 2 weeks out but what you‚Äôre doing makes sense I‚Äôd just call it something else. Lol whatever tho, you look great dude goodluck!"
Hell yeah brother
Hey cutie
"Idk why they downvoted me above, but my metabolism is crazy fast. My last cut with my coach i dropped 10 lbs in a week with just less carbs and zero cardio."
This one is bad. Exceptional father and husband. He undoubtedly would‚Äôve discussed this with his family after his first heart attack- his family and kids knows he loved them and that‚Äôs all that matters. Going to miss this guy.
"A few things here are just wrong.  2.2g per pound is just way too much and is going to use up all your calories.  You only need 1.2-1.3g/lb tops.  As for BCAA's, you don't need them as long as your protein intake is good.  You should be getting enough bcaa's from your protein intake alone and supplementing is a waste.  I agree with shifting from running to lifting more.  Build some more muscle and the cutting will get easier."
Congrats on the win man. I‚Äôm in Az and looking for a coach I‚Äôll be contacting you through Instagram. Keep it up you have a great future ahead of you.
Promise?
"I like the spotter, like he‚Äôs gonna do ANYTHING if this goes bad. Hahaha"
Alright that‚Äôs fair. I‚Äôll own up to that and work on making that change.
diet is infinitely more important than training
"It'll catch up both ways, but yeah setting the reps up with the weak leg first makes it so you don't overshoot your rep range."
"He was black version of good ol J.G

"I don't know man, seems like you reached your natty limit time to hop on"
"Yes when I was a kid I thought because I wanted to gain muscle and was into a lot of ‚Äòmale‚Äô stuff I could be a trans man. But now I realise I just want to be a badass muscular strong woman, and because of my biology I may need a bit of ‚Äòartificial‚Äô help to get to my ideal physique, something like Brooke Ence, or Dana linn Bailey who both have taken gear.

That‚Äôs reassuring to know no matter what I‚Äôll still be a female since I have xx chromosomes even if I have a hell of a lot of muscle, and if I mess up my dose and get some virilisation. 

I definitely don‚Äôt have any gender dysphoria üëç"
"I'm like pretty sure you can't target inner chest to any significant degree, so I'd say keep it growing focusing on both heads of the muscle and eventually it'll fill out?"
Looking great!
Loses are also gains lmao.
Definitely Arnold
Lol oops
Wow a troll with no posts of those own achievements.  How refreshingly [different...](https://giphy.com/gifs/beyonc-michelle-williams-say-yes-cmq29uCuYc0k8)
Bro your the stinky dude at the gym
"I did not want to confirm it on my other post until I was 100% sure and could confirm it but I will be competing in physique. Because at one point I considered pulling out as well but I still think I will bring a really good package. This will be the first time they host physique both for women and men. We will be 6 women competing this year.

Wish me good luck! :)"
It's even better once you put a sauce on it.
"Thats a pretty outdated view. The use of Rest and Ice has been questioned and found to limit the bodies own capabilities.

Its why ""Rest and Ice"" has been replaced with ""[Peace &amp; Love](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/54/2/72/F1.medium.gif)"" by most evidence based practicioners and school programs.

Ice mostly has some analgesic effects, which can be useful for multi day events(Think strongman taking icebaths on saturday on a weekend event). But not long term tissue repair."
"Yeah, better shoulder, chest, abs and arms for sure but the legs have the shape they just need the size paired with better conditioning and some muscle maturity he will take the title."
anything over 2 pl8s is belt worthy
Thanks man
"Damn babe thanks for all the episodes! Saved the comment.

It‚Äôs 100% a fascinating asf concept. There‚Äôs so much unknown it can keep the mind thinking forever. Where‚Äôd you get to meet with the director?"
Sounds a bit backhanded but I‚Äôm pretty sure it isn‚Äôt lol
"No, he didn't it's called getting older. He's in his 30s now, not in his 20s. Most people from middle/high school I know have ""ruined"" their faces in their 30s: gone bald, fat, totally different face structure, etc. It's called aging badly. Heck, I have had trouble recognizing some of them lmao."
"Been having problems with my right shoulder since I was a teenager, after minor accident.

The most important part for me was learning what exercises hurt my shoulder (some upright rows, heavy side raises, heavy dips)

Also do exercises that strenghten the rotator cuff, such as face pulls"
Still waiting to see what you look like 11 call outs and 30 days later....guess they're never coming....ü§£
"Maybe she'll come along, she likes making friends too! 

Awesome, I have a guest pass thing at my local Crunch if you're cool with it! I'm not trying to black out at bars *every* night, but occasionally it's fun lmao

Just followed"
"&gt; pasta so easy to overeat too

I don't think I've ever been able to eat the *correct* amount of pasta. It's 100% always overeat.. I just love it so much."
"It seems normal that the best weightlifters, mechanically speaking, would be between 5‚Äô5‚Äù-5‚Äô10‚Äù. The build and limb length of those guys is just more athletic than taller longer limbed athletes."
"Man, I ended my cut at 2,250 calories per day because I had stalled out, so I decided I want to start bulking back up . So went to 2,750 per day. Dropped another 2 lbs. So went to 3,000. Lost another pound. Up to 3,250 and holding weight."
Very very sad. Always breaks my heart when bodybuilders die young.
One of the best pics I have seen of Logan. No one touching the champ though.
"Thank you! And, thanks for the heads up on HBD, I'll look into it and order. Noted on the deficit, will try to hit maintenance once my appetite comes back (they tell me the first few days will have some nausea). Really appreciate it!"
Well I hope your time off reddit served it‚Äôs purpose and that you‚Äôre well. I was thinking about u during lockdown!
"Nah, calves can get big and still look goofy with high insertions. Biceps can get huge and without a peak they kind of look like ""okay now flex"" ""I AM, FYM???"" Contrary to this discussion on lats, there are high lats and low lats. There are plenty of guys with much bigger backs than Arnold ever had, yet they don't hang as low as Arnold's."
"Nice man, yeah learnt alot from John training gear nutrition etc, just a great man that'll be forever missed"
"Looks like a shaved gorilla trying to disguise as a human, but the face gives it away."
Aren‚Äôt those ones usually the good ones?
I am not yet 30 and want to died. This guy is awsome he lived that long.
Lucky that you workout somewhere where someone like him works out!
Anyone else dislike curls?
Good looks.
"Dude, it‚Äôs the best steroid don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise üí™"
"You for sure have more room to bulk a decent length I'd time without getting chubby, so I would say go for that unless you have a reason for needing to be lean in the next few months."
Thanks brother!!!
"classic physique...

I want bodies like Eugen Sandow back. Natural yet looking strong."
Nice alt account
Great physique
"Yes, you‚Äôll see results with 7 days on/7 days off."
"No. Not everyone responds to gear the same way. Some people are able to respond to relatively low doses and get gigantic, whereas others just don‚Äôt respond well at all. The vast majority of people on steroids look like shit. Hell, Jon Skywalker is pretty open about what he takes and he doesn‚Äôt look anything like a men‚Äôs open competitor. He looks fantastic for sure, but he‚Äôs not gigantic by any means. Response to gear is everything, and some people just so happen to respond ridiculously well"
That‚Äôs amazing work and congratulations üéâüçæüéä
Yeah I just changed up my program after 8 weeks. I used to do chest twice a week but decided to focus on back and shoulders a bit for this next 8 weeks.
Jesus you look like an anime character. Good freaking work bro! Good luck
he's sexy
It's quite a technical exercise but feel good when you properly internalise the technique.
Holy shit you really do look like a high schooler. How old are ya?
"Semantics. She‚Äôs *not looking* for casual sex, doesn‚Äôt mean she doesn‚Äôt have casual sex"
No.
"yeah i'm working on that with dumbbells now, avoiding the lockout and trying to keep all the tension on my pecs, it feels better than the barbell bench. any advantages of doing the barbell instead?"
"Good luck mate, persistence does pay off eventually."
"Is lifting useless when I don't eat enough protein but eat the right amount of calories?
  

  
I'm a male 16 years old and I weigh about 62 kg/136 lbs and am 161 cm tall. I've been learning through the years about fitness and this year I really learned a lot. My goal is to be shredded not to be like a bodybuilder type of body. I eat like 50-60 grams of protein a day, I live with my family so I cannot really prep and pick my meals and I don't have money to buy protein powders because it's really expensive and I don't have money but I tell my mom to cook foods with a lot of protein but it's not everyday high protein because she has to cook for the family. I've been thinking that should I stop working out because I can't eat enough protein."
frick these awards
Lol made me chuckle
Burning more energy?
"Yeah a decade already and it still feels like last week it was blasting hardstyle, trolling and having a good time, better era. Always a sick cunt, rip brah."
Thank you! I‚Äôm in the zone!
Loss of grip? Too much momentum? Sorry about that
"Worst most tired take ever

No they are not two sides of the fucking coin christ"
"""remember shows are won from the (back)"" Chris Aceto"
Maybe you could eat in a very small deficit until you can workout again. You wont lose a lot of muscle in 1 month.
"Do what makes you happy bb. I'm also a former athlete who quit my sport for the full time gym. I'm much happier this way, but you can definitely do both. Think of soccer as cardio. It's also nice to have some variety in life. Remember you don't have to lift every single day."
"Awwwwhhh bless, someone's jealous"
Beautiful. no homo.
"Already implemented, I‚Äôm just a fat fuck :p but seriously, I just need to go back to filling myself with greens. I already drink water to curb the appetite just need to make the transition from starchy/dense carbs to greens and I‚Äôll be good to go. Easier said than done..."
"I know others disagree, but I've personally never understood pre-exhausting for compounds. I understand the rational that  it lets you push a targeted muscle to failure/exhaustion before some other part of the compound fails, but I never understood why you wouldn't just hit the compound without a purposeful weak link then push the chosen muscle to failure *after* with the isolation. You get the muscle to exhaustion either way and you get more out of the compound for your other muscles. 

I don't know, just seems like trying to eat soup with a spoon, making a compound movement more isolating. Just use a different movement if that's your goal."
Thank god
"Yeah I'm the same way man, front delt massively more developed than the other two heads. We just gotta keep the volume higher on the rear and lateral delts than front until they even out bud, we'll get there!"
"Bro, you look amazing. I‚Äôm not gonna tell you to ignore that inner dialogue of ‚Äúwhy Do I feel skinny‚Äù, on the other hand, I say use it as fuel to become better and stronger. Most people (90% of gym goers) quit before they even reach 150 pounds let alone 160. Keep going. And btw I was also confused when I saw that a lot of bodybuilders I follow are actually low weight even tho they seem so muscular! But apparently Weight doesn‚Äôt matter because muscle tissue is more dense than fat tissue, which means it takes up less space at the same weight"
Why don't you want to be called pretty?
Thx but is it good for my AGE though
Good job!!
tired of small legs. any downfalls of hitting a few sets of moderate intensity leg extensions every day in addition to hitting legs twice a week?
Well it‚Äôs pretty clear a lot of you hate Nick and somehow think he has bad genetics for bodybuilding? He‚Äôs thicker than Jay was at this point and still is doing great with his midsection control. I personally think he‚Äôs the future of the sport (at the very least a top 3 in the world after he matures). Also I love this type of bodybuilding and this post has made me very aware most of you hate it. Wish there was a subreddit for appreciating today‚Äôs bodybuilding and judging them based off actual bodybuilding metrics and not a beauty radar
"Thanks man, it‚Äôs genuinely all an illusion lol. My hips are pretty wide so I wanted a better taper, so I just focused on bringing my lats up for the past few years and kept oblique training minimal."
He always looks like he is super super super high
Wtf? Why aren‚Äôt you allowed to cook things in the microwave? What‚Äôs it for then? Decoration?
Ah yeah that makes sense. Thanks I appreciate your help!
"Yeah man, mine always seemed to go away until this. I tried doing IMS which helped a bit but I‚Äôve started doing shockwave therapy which has helped the most so far"
"I have had a very strained relationship with almost all of my family my entire life. When I told my parents I wanted to be a bodybuilder at 16 and this is what I‚Äôm doing with my life they told me no and that it‚Äôs stupid/gay etc. I continued anyways because this is my absolute passion. They didn‚Äôt understand when I couldn‚Äôt eat dinner with them, or go on vacation or anything normal really. I moved out on my own at 17 with my girlfriend and current wife, she understood what I‚Äôm doing and completely supports me 100% to this day. That being said this is absolutely very difficult for a person with a healthy/ normal home life. My family pretends to support me but deep down I know this ain‚Äôt what they wanted for me, regardless this is my life and I‚Äôm doing what I love."
You fuckin got it. Easy enough
"Prove it lol, you must be a greek god now, right?"
Uhhhh chicken breast and other lean cuts of meat? Why do you have to resort to a large amount of protein powder?
depends on how many stars you want
"&gt;‚Äúradically accept the facts.‚Äù They had this very creepy pamphlet about how once facts are established, it‚Äôs against the rules to not radically accept them, by which they again mean convince the staff you emphatically believe them.

Yeah that's where I'd draw the line. The therapy staff are humans, humans will make mistakes. They're terrible therapists if they're not open to improvement, even if they've done this thousands of times."
"Yeah I'm not vegan. Not even remotely close. I typically advise against vegan diets to those who aren't ""initiated"" within the ins and outs of intricacies in nutrition. That's a distant cry from the dumb things you've claimed throughout the course of this thread though. Don't know who quoted fitness influencers, I'm not familiar with any of that nonsense.

I've published and co-authored enough to understand when it's appropriate to reference studies. In this case, again, I literally just don't need to. The things I've outlined are well-understood scientific basics. OP's physique isn't ""big"" that would warrant your accusations, and you can certainly build muscle on a deficit. The biological systems that facilitate muscle growth and caloric regulation can work separately unless you're on like on 800 calorie deficit. This is empirical science and is as clear cut as me pointing to a watermelon, informing you that it's a watermelon and you asking for a study to prove that it is a watermelon

"Damn, poor Calum has lost both pets this month. He just posted on IG"
I'm giving it to cbum just cuz he has a better v taper
I‚Äôll check both out. Thanks so much man! If it kicks my ass it should build muscle for me as well right?
"Lookin sick bro
Just wondering :do you measure Biceps, quads etc?"
"great physique.

trunks in photo look kind of odd, but you own it."
I don't know if maybe I just got lucky but I was only feeling shitty for about 24-36 hours.

I fucking hate that shit so god damned much holy fuck that's inconsiderate. My dad just doesn't ask and assumed I should go out and help him without considering or asking if I have plans
always love the lines in his biceps
"Ahhh, fair enough. Maybe just take it easy/easier for now?"
Yeah I agree. I didnt do jack shit for side delts especially the past years and they used to be my strong point actually.
"Long ass torso and the obliques pop too much. Much prefer Samson‚Äôs taper even if his abs are split, the waist flows better into the hips from the lats."
He'd be 5th tops if he's lucky.
"I agree about Derek coming in 100% better than last competitions, but Kamal and Shaun are ahead on conditioning. If he stays with Rambod its a different story a year from now. I think at this point in time its a toss up between Kamal/Shaun and Derek in 3rd. Finals could be a different story if someone comes in off."
"Literally hold your arms straight above your head until your delts start to burn, then hold it for 2 minutes longer, repeat for 30 mins. You will get doms. Doesn‚Äôt do shit for delts but creating doms on any muscle, if that‚Äôs the only goal, is pretty easy."
"He paid his dues. He's free to move on. People respect it when someone who did something wrong, redeem themselves through accountability."
Get this shit off of here jeez
"Food, proper rest and good workouts definitely make a difference haha thanks bro!"
"
Congratulations Brother! Hard work pays off!"
Yeah he sounds beyond repair at this point
Just get it tattoos always look better when you‚Äôre slimmer anyways
I feel like you‚Äôve been going forever now. Looking great!
If it‚Äôs anything like my old apartment 15 minutes before the timer goes off.
What would they be screaming?
16-19 year olds at the gym love swarming machines with groups of 4+ and not putting their weight back when they're done
"So I agree yea I need more time to build muscle to be super competitive but just doing the comp is the point for me, and there are TEEN divisions ya know, let alone the INBF where if I go I‚Äôm bound to win something against some of these natural guys"
Thanks brother üí™üèæüí™üèæ. Head to nationals and get a pro card.
"it seems to me like you don't know much about posing and is only good at criticizing. you haven't seen bad posing if you think this is ""very, very"" bad. I get you don't got anything to prove to me but your comments make me very curious of your physique and posing. Talk is cheap man, if you really want to showcase your posing anonymously, you can."
"He looked great last hear, should been number 2.  Big Ramy‚Äôs outer quads are just so freaky."
"Plenty of time for pull-ups for sure, EMG data shows more activation weighted push-ups vs bench press too"
RIP in peace
thoughts on no carbs/higher fat in last meal to improve insulin sensitivity on a bulk?
"Yeah this is what I was thinking. I mean Ramy just overwhelms Hadi. I think regardless of Hadi's physique, if Big Ramy comes in at the next Olympia with the same physique no one's beating him. Hadi is what maybe 5'5"" or shorter? Ramy is like 5'8"" with a bigger frame and more room to play around with. Hadi would dominate the 212 division. 

I really don't get the heights of these bodybuilders. Phil Heath is suppose to be 5'9"" yet Ramy who is 5'8"" towered over him, yet Ramy looked in line with Chris Bumstead who is suppose to be around 6'2""? And Phil Heath played basketball as someone who is around 5'7"". How on earth does that even work? 

Even Phil Heath looked small in front of Ramy. I mean Ramy looked like a freaking monster with his size. He was just huge relative to everyone."
Will check out thanks
I think maybe my problem is fear a little too. Today I tried 150.5 kg in squat and I made it! It wasn‚Äôt that hard and I think perhaps my max would be 200! So excited!
"Anyone have any idea why it would feel like my vastus lateralis is gonna just absolutely tear off my leg when I try to do any squat type motion where my feet are pointing directly forward? It's only in one leg, have had this issue the entire time Ive been lifting."
Maintain for the same duration as you cut and awaken that urge to gain gang
either way he's a beautiful chocolate man
Quickly? You looking to have nasty dry chicken?
Well if the answer is no then clearly the only solution is to ask him ‚Äúdo you even lift?‚Äù and then overhead press him to assert dominance.
Thank you!
"You appear to be lost, here's your link back to r/fitness"
I believe it's like 10 or 15 lbs.
"Probably has a bunch of trash calories like sugar or oils. Not bad for bulking. Not good for being healthy 

Maybe if the bulk of the calories come from peanut butter or something it could be solid"
The dog does not look the least bit impressed.
he looks fuckin sick. his amateur career will be very very short lol.
Fyi: hanging leg raises dont work the abs primarily. They act as a stabilizer.
"I do it when dieting down to get a better idea of my conditioning, but I work in steel toe cowboy style boots so really don't like the feeling of skin or high socks rubbing against the sides of my boots for a 10-12 hour shift."
Nice shape! How many years training?
"Yes, I used it for pec flys. You use them if you bit down when you push/pull a weight, and you tuck your chin in. Usually its only for pretty heavy weights, so I don't use it often. 

I used to get a sore/clicking(?) jaw, and I find it helped. I use the mouthguard you use for any other sport."
Like when Levrone or Flex Wheeler quote Candace Owens with that shit? Yeah that's fucking cringe.
"Good fucking morning god damn it 

I hope every has a great fucking day today

What‚Äôs everyone hitting today?"
While ramy will be hard to beat if he is improved and conditioned. I think Brandon as the best shot to win if ramy is not at his best. Especially he curry improved his legs
honestly i dont trust myself to find a credible source and would feel a lot better about it knowing there was no chance i was pinning some random shit
"Your chest is pretty lacking but for MP it's not a big deal. Hammies could use some work if you plan on doing Classic or Open at some point. Otherwise you look great bro! Thick. Solid. Tight. 

I'm wondering why you're hitting a side tri in MP though? Pretty cool that they let you do it"
Thanks brother!
Such a shame he got hurt. Would have been really interesting to see how he did vs. the top guys in that era.
oh damn!
WOW
"That last point you made is so true man. They go out of their way to avoid the yolk because it has a tiny amount of fat in it, but then they go on to add fats that they deem healthy. But is olive oil a healthier fat than an egg yolk? (assuming you're not eating a dozen eggs a day)"

"Damn dude sick physique, what's your body fat percentage"
"Sounds like something that happened to me a couple weeks back, felt a pop and sharp pain but was able to finish the rep and the rest of my push day with lighter weight. Pain went a way in less then a week and I‚Äôm back to lifting normal now"
Thanks alot man will do this from next week
Yea no thanks I‚Äôll stick with animal protein.
"Yes that is definitely true, but working out on your abs helps to define it and thicken it."

"Yoyo dieting is considered repeatedly losing weight then regaining it. So any form of bulking and cutting is classified as yoyo dieting regardless of how fast you switch between a surplus and deficit. 

Your BMR is a basically just function of your weight, body composition, and to a lesser extent genetics. That ignores a few small details but that's an accurate model. Your BMR and body composition is not significantly impacted by whether or not you immediately switch to a surplus or you reverse diet"
"Yeah it's called overly taxed and possibly damaged kidneys, most likely from being on amphetamines for adhd starting at 7 years old. The diagnosis doesn't matter, being aware and taking precautions does which Im doing"
Wow
"Absurd volume, lots of cheat reps, lots of high rep sets, but also occasional mind muscle sets and dropsets/supersets. 

I also make sure to switch things up all the time. I‚Äôll only do the same arm movement for a month or two before switching. And I‚Äôm always looking for new weird ways to hit them. Today I found a sick cable Tricep exercise where you lay the bench in front and below it, backwards facing out, and do pushdowns while lying on the bench. Craaaaaazy pump and stretch. Just try out new things and find what gives you that pump!!"
"I still think Breon looks better than Cbum and Terrance overall. Much better conditioning than Cbum and much more details than Cbum and Terrance. Cbum and Terrance both have a better structure than Breon and certainly have some body parts that are better or comparable but pose for pose, I just don't think they beat him although I could see an argument for Cbum because of his insane structure, certain poses and size."

"Just all the stress from the pandemic hit me, that plus being on a cut has been too much. I never have anxiety but I'm just not happy right now, lacking positive things in life in general."
"Update: so iam sorry it took this long my doc was a bum and didn‚Äôt so the cause was simply anxiety since i was running 1100mg‚Äôs of caffein and i was already hit by my fathers death back when i was 16 in 2017 so yeah the caffeine was the cherry on top the depression i already started to drown.  I feel much better now after i talked to an neurologist and that he got to talk with me about the root of my problem my braun is simply afraid if caffeine and i had to start drinking a little bit of caffeine and i stopped worrying because i was worrying about death that i‚Äôll not be able to do what i promised my ild man and someone else who also used to be a very good body builder and is part of my family sadly that dude never had the chance to show what he got so he was kinda wasted. I‚Äôll try live up to their expectations since bodybuilding for me has become a personal matter rather than just a hobby i like. Also i noticed how my anxiety would die when i play beatsaber on expert which i use for cardio haha, i hope you all will have a good time, may good bless you all."
Lol!! Not sure...

Three years for what lol. He can be healthy in half a year
"Glad to hear it. Wyd for cardio?? 

I'm used to running slighly less than 50k per week before I gained all this fat so I was going to do 5 to 10k five days per week, with a max of 40 collectively."

"A calorie is a measure of the energy you get from food.

Carbs are carbohydrates, a kind of food like protein and fat.

"That's what worries me about him. I get that it's bodybuilding, but the guy practically doubled in size over a period of three years.

The vericose veins are worrying as well..."

"Sucks your getting down voted by these guys that are just fan boys when you are right. His only actual transition is from his Lat Spread through to his Side Chest, after that he just does a basic set up to his back pose and even pauses to do a ‚Äúhype up‚Äù motion, which isn‚Äôt posing.
His physique is fantastic no doubt, but this routine wasn‚Äôt anything special."

Nope . Pull ups are one of the best exercises you can do ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ if you can do them
"They‚Äôre pretty fun, it‚Äôs like a standing preaching curl."
Opinions on running CD2 on a mild deficit?
"Yes, training volume stimulates the body to build muscle mass. Overall strength is highly correlated with muscle cross-sectional area, so you will get stronger. You need a caloric surplus too, so eat a lot, but lifting weights is key."
"lol..yeah I do what douche bags say..go suck your girlfriend's boyfriend's cock and choke on it, like you do every other Tuesday.. learn some manners and go thumb thug someone else, you aren't impressing anyone. there is zero chance I give you anymore jerk off material."
Two a day workouts and lifting partners like Jared feather and Mike israetel helps too. Along with experienced coaches running your cycles and PCT.
Am I doing it wrong or right? Any tips I'm not the best at posing

Listen I‚Äôve messed with you long enough, and I should‚Äôve stopped a while ago.

I mean this very sincerely: you seem really young (not in a negative way). It‚Äôs a bummer to be jaded at any age but it is especially sad to be hateful and jaded when you‚Äôre young. Ideally your outlook on life is a little more positive. So, maybe unplug from whatever it is that has stoked so much hatred in you. In the end, you‚Äôre the one that loses.

Hope you have a good day, take it easy"

"Filling out your frame can help so much, just dont buy into the ‚Äúinner chest‚Äù workouts and people saying you can target that. Bring up the chest and the gap will get smaller and smaller as you fill out. Keep it up!"
"Thanks man! Bulk started at 170lbs at the beginning of February.

I don't typically track my big 3 but I can say I did add weight to them all.  Throughout this bulk I've been doing an Arnold Split and have been doing bench and squat as part of them but not deadlifts.  My working weight on squats and bench probably went up 15 or 20lbs over the course of the bulk.  I have been doing RDL's on leg day and those prob went up 20lbs over the bulk.

Once a year I do a mock PL competition for people with home gyms and all 3 lifts were up on that from last year (Squat +20, Bench +20, Deadlift +15)"
So just more food would lead to like 80 more pounds of quality muscle? Why don't every other bodybuilder just do that if it's so easy?
"It wasn‚Äôt my comment, but okay"
üòÇ cancelled üòÇ sounds like a bunch of kids who don‚Äôt even contribute anything financially to the Olympia anyway.
Thanks man I keep this in mind and check out jps website
190lb of lean mass wouldn‚Äôt be a bad start. At like 12% BF you‚Äôd be about 215. So aim for that.
No you‚Äôre tall and sexy bb
Yup. Pretty controversial to win when you're not going against anyone else. I felt no one should have won that year.
"Lmao your fianc√©e is totally overshadowed by your ass, congratulations btw!"
"True. I've tried deadlifting for a couple years and I've finally come to terms with the fact that it's just not a lift for me. No matter how good my form, I almost always get low back pain. Barring about 3 times I didn't, it's just not worth it. I can hit all those muscles other ways... But it sucks cuz it's a fun lift that makes me feel like a badass (then I'm like, ow my fucking back)."
I love how serious he is about the ball
Congrats on the big win brother sounds like you had an incredible game!!   One of the best feelings in the world is popping off in any type of competitive event.

Yeah my weight cap is 182 and I‚Äôm 194 right now with 8 weeks left. Only worried about coming in flat but maybe I‚Äôll drop to the high 170s then carb up those 2-3 days before
Yes. We just need the next genetic phreak to come out of the shadows. Or maybe wait for Phil Heath to announce his predecessor. But knowing Phil he wouldn't want to have anyone shadow him. Much like how Jay Cutler chose young Phil to replace and dominate him...Mr Phil can't fathom being bottomed out.
Baby Groot even week Friday. Got a nasty tricep pump on the last set of Tate presses.
I was born with pretty big lats as well as playing baseball and doing manual labor most of my life. I grew up with parents who flipped houses so I was constantly using my back to move and tear stuff up. Ig it gave it a huge headstart compared to the rest of my physique

Looking good! How long have you been training?
Felt my lats working on dumbbell rows however it wasnt even near the contractions i get from v handle tbar rows or chest supported incline rows. After the rows i did pull ups and was surprised i could only do 2 maybe 3 if i really pushed myself when i can normally get 10. Should i still work on mmc with dumbbell rows or am i good?
Lmao this looks legit!

"I was trying to avoid unnecessary wear on the band by using the nylon loop on the floor and attaching the ends of bands to the bar.

Looping the band around the bar would work but I was concerned the knurling on the bar would damage the bands, and also I'd need two points of attachment on the floor.   Home gym, no rack."
"Honestly it's probably no big deal at all, but if you've got a nasty bicep pump you probably can't get as much stretch from your tricep. If I make a fist, I can tough my thumb to my shoulder pretty easily without a bicep pump, but when I've got a pump I can just about get my fingertips to my shoulders lol, and my biceps aren't even impressive. That extra inch or two might do absolutely nothing, but it's like min-maxing your character in a game, and that extra bit of stretch might make that last bit of difference, it's like a cherry on top."
That lower back damn.
This is like that picture comparing Shaq Kevin hart and yoa Ming.

You look great! Focus on breathing when you pose..it doesn‚Äôt sound important but when you‚Äôre on stage you‚Äôll know. It well help you be less shaky and hold the pose longer without cramping.

..... IME there are plenty of worse things to contend with training at a commercial gym but sure
"Agreed on the former, but neither are the majoriy of users here. 

Disagree on the second in the sense that there is not only one way or set of ways to train 'like a bodybuilder'. That mindset is needlessly limiting and weirdly common. Plenty of ways to grow and implying that some aren't 'right' because they don't fit the preconceived notion of how bodybuilders are supposed to train doesn't really help anyone."
"Thanks for the subreddit suggestion. I'll consider eating more. I've actually been cutting down on carbs, fats, and glucose during the span of my core training. Besides that, I'm compensating for them by eating healthier alternatives when I can. E.g., protein, dairy, vegetables, lean meat."

How important is full range of motion when deadlifting? I need to buy a silencer drop pad so I don‚Äôt bother my neighbors. It will raise the bar a few inches.

I will give that a try thanks brotha!
"Haha yeah man I was in Boxing/MMA so lots of cardio until I got my arm snapped in an arm bar I started working out to strengthen my elbow, once i seen some gains I hopped on some GNC mass gainer got to the 120Lbs range and never stopped"

Looks like Mac's cultivating mass paid off!
I appreciate the advice! But if I do go with the cycle do you reckon andriol capsules are of any help? During or for the pct?
"I am a huge fan of Ant, watch all his vids and follow his prep.  I like his attitude and seems like a solid guy.  However, saying that he is int he league of getting a Pro Card seems a bit far-fetched, at least at this point in his career."

"god i cant fucking wait for the conservative thought train to finally be normal again. im pretty dam left, but i think having discourse is just so fucking important and id love to be challenged on my views, but when they come from ""inherent racism, lack of empathy, and the inability to think critically or think for myself(themselves)"" its just not worth listening to. i used to entertain my dad who says hes independent but is definitely conservative until he told me hes a racist hes just not loud about it. i honestly feel bad for the conservatives who dont support trump or the things going on. i actually just feel bad for all of us now that i think about it."
Ok great

"How do you guys decide how low to go on the leg press?

There's a general notion that the larger the ROM of a movement the better the hypertrophy, but I am quite flexible and can go all the way past the brake point (so the maximum possible ROM). My reps then feel much more glute powered than quad powered.

My purpose here is just quad hypertrophy btw. (And I do set my feet very low and close together.)"

Damn, my sleep is so much better and restful, it's so easy to get 8 hours now. I feel tired at the right time and don't feel the urge to dick around on my phone/tablet. Perhaps there's a middle ground here when I come off this, where I just have pre-workout only since I workout in the mornings before work. Decaf for the rest of the day. There should hopefully be little caffeine left in my system by bedtime."
Looking solid. Wish you well at your upcoming shows!

It's like any other sport. At the highest levels it becomes who has the best physiology to succeed. That shouldn't discourage anybody from competing though.
"I want to say that he won‚Äôt make it, but as someone who has proven people wrong, and seeing many other ppl (friends, families, social media influencers) proving ‚Äúhaters‚Äù wrong, I‚Äôm not gonna just flat out say nah he won‚Äôt make it. 

You never know‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not impossible"
"I guess I picked a shitty analogy, was just trying to say people who do this the most will be exposed to the most people who might also have underlying issues which occur in a standard frequency in the population. Oh well, guess my playing devils advocate fell flat ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Exactly! And let me just expand on the point I made above that you also touched base on about the job. Notice how I didn't say a high-paying job. 

Potential partners (regardless of gender) like to know that you've got stability and they like to see you be passionate about something. You don't need a ""good"" job, just do the best that you can wherever you are, and find a good hobby that you're passionate about outside of work."
"Does Ryan Terry have like no vascularity or is that just me? I've never seen it in photos and then I looked at training footage when he's diced to the socks with shoulder striations, yet I can't see a bicep vein mid-curl"
"Well yes, but you can find some more interesting workouts online than just pushups and pullups"
No i am calling Paul Dillet un conditioned...you're funny though boy x
The problem is that theres always variance in the accuracy of your caloric and energy expenditure. We can get very good ESTIMATES of what we burn during a workout and how much we consume but its nearly impossible to always know to a tiny margin what we burn during exercise. Hence its better imo to go a bit over than go for the perfect minimum. Daily energy expenditure for instance is NEVER the same. Maybe you bounced your leg at your desk for 10 minutes more than you average and that burned 10 more calories. Why risk losing your gains by trying to eat the minimum over your DEE?
"Americans be like Im irish mate, never having left the state of texas"
Either or but I'd recommend having some food before working out.
Looks like a well bathed normal sized man inside an oiled muscle suit
It's crazy what myonuclei can do when you've created enough of it from years of training.
"Forget the back, this guys neck has wings."
"Yeah I agree. When I go to the gym I try and super set most exercises (other than the heaviest lifts I start my workout with).

I was just wondering if you had like 2-3 hours between exercises if you could lift more (presumably yes) and therefore make bigger gains.

We're on the same page though, it's a hypothetical question really because I was considering involving training like this alongside my normal gym workouts."
"True. I wish I knew what would make me happy over what I think may make me happy. Only to get there and expecting a windfall of emotion and warm glow, or at least feel like I'm glowing like a fireball in the night sky. Except I'm not."
No
"Wait Jesus fuck I have actually made fookin abysmal progress in the last MULTIPLE years. Looking at old lifting videos, this is horribly depressing. 

Finishing this cut out strong even though I‚Äôm small, then sending it on a bulk. Perfect sleeP. Perfect diet. Planned out meals, pre workout, post workout meals, well structured program with scheduled deloads 

Fookin abysmal i tell you.."
I sure hope so
Fuck it was probably radioactive.  Yikes.
"Man, I'm surprised by the top comments, they seem to make sense, when something related to exercise gets popular in Reddit it's usually full of people putting excuses."
Looking pretty solid tho ‚ù§Ô∏è good job
"Haha that‚Äôs exactly how I do them too, I just avoid them cause I‚Äôm a tremendous germaphobe. Even that is too close for me. Lying leg curl always makes me uncomfortable too"
Well done!  Those abs are super!

"Funny enough my planet fitness in georgia requires you to wear a mask to get in but you are not required to wear it while actually working out. Like almost everyone there, I take it off the minute I get onto the floor, maybe 1/4 of the people there are wearing masks. Im vaccinated and dont give a fuck now, but like also the gym was the one and only place I didnt wear a mask before this soooooo"
Yeah I didn‚Äôt do a long term remake. They deleted the boost for short term remakes because people like me were abusing it since their system tanks your account over time to make you pay money for premium

Lol yeah that‚Äôs me
Welcome cunt &lt;3
"I was fat and bad looking in general until I was 19-20. Then I got skinny and from there went into the eternal loop of bulk a bit and cut a bit so little progress.

What made me not care about how I look was gaining the real confidence problem I had that was social interaction in general, and with women in particular. Just exposing myself to social situations and having to interact with new people, with time made me comfortable and with it came not caring about how I see myself. I mean, I think I'm fat and small but it doesn't bother me, it's just a reason to improve and keep pushing in the gym so that's a positive IMO."
Well you made a joke then referenced real things like the posters and murals. I get sarcasm but there‚Äôs just too many smooth brains on here
Thanks!
"Shit your 16!! You don't need shit! Lifting weight is supposed to be fun! When I was your age i had a 305 bench, 435 squat and 485 deadlift!(6'4 195-200lbs)... Hit the gym with a good split and eat it all!"
I wish chipotle could add potatoes. That‚Äôs be bomb
Pretty sure that‚Äôs still the average weight
"That‚Äôs loose skin my guy. However it is not a severe amount of loose skin. I could be wrong though. I don‚Äôt have any experience with that. Regardless, you look like you‚Äôre in good shape. It might get worse as you cut a little more. But it might become less significant over time as you bulk and cut and bulk and cut. Idk. I wouldn‚Äôt stress about it. I don‚Äôt think there are any ways to quickly get rid of it besides filling it up (gaining the wait back) or surgery"
Only thing you didn't have that was better than everyone else is calfs. And I don't think not having calfs should degrade you from 1st to 6th. The judges were not professional at all.
"Sounds like she left out your calves, bro."
I'm trying to lose a lot of fat and I'm not deficiting above normal for how much I weigh (at most it's a 1000 calorie deficit and I weigh 105kg on a 176cm body). My nutrition is on point and my sleep is not too terrible either. I'm not following any program

"Yeah you're absolutely right, we only get one body after all. Not to mention alot of dudes on gear particularly harder shit are way more at risk for heart disease, combined with a huge ass frame I also definitely wouldn't risk anything if that was case, it'd be foolish to straight up encourage people to increase their cholesterol on a subreddit like this, but I am highly curious about what relationship they have between each other and it's still worth talking about when cholesterol is the precursor to any anabolic hormone."

"Yeah, natural guys can get pretty big if they have a reasonable body fat percentage. I would love to see a separate category of natural bodybuilding where the contestants were a little fluffy but with actual muscle mass."
Seriously - old directors seemed to have ironically poor taste in aesthetics.
yeah george and john were both mass monsters /s
the cuts gonna go crazy brotha
Gonna be a year of shitty homeworkouts with shitty old weights in a cramped room coming up for me. It's so demoralizing seeing something that used to be enjoyable and rewarding turn into a chore that gives diminishing returns. Lifting at home feels like your desperately clinging onto gains that will leave anyways. But we carry on!
"looking good, gyno makes you look a little fatter so don't be discouraged"

Your motivations for deciding to hop off are sound. There are more important things in life, and if you're living somewhere in which the consequences of possession are more dire, it makes perfect sense.

"I‚Äôll just be pissed if another coach comes out and says their athlete‚Äôs bloodwork is ‚Äúperfect‚Äù only for them to later die from a ‚Äúpreexisting condition‚Äù known as ‚Äúexcessive anabolic use‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt know if Jansen had a big role to play in Dallas‚Äô death but it‚Äôs all too common for coaches to bullshit super hard when it comes to mass monsters. No Olympian is going to have good blood work; they might have good blood work for a *bodybuilder* on significant amounts of research chemicals."
"&gt; Dudes claimed sub 1% bf, negative bf, natty when he won the olympia

I could totally see the bf thing coming from him maybe using a less than reliable, shall we say, test that gave him that ridiculous result and he thought it was correct/just went with it anyway.

He's usually said at other times that he was natty at first and got a pro card that way but didn't start winning the Olympia until after Flex introduced him to certain compounds. You can really never be certain of shit he's said because as you said, it's all over the place"
Is this the same guy that kept arguing with a teenager on a live stream?
Best comment today.
I always want to ask id I can skip if if I show them a vid of me gobblin some knob. At least they‚Äôre good for identifying the single digit IQ homophobe fuckers.

It was a bad joke and my legs are bigger than your future little guy
Natural lol
I feel similarly after going from gamma bomb to building the colossus. Being able to give it my all for just a set or two feels fantastic.
Are there any amazing protein sales going on rn? Myprotein has a lot but they also jack up the prices conveniently
Haha holy shit I cant believe you said that. We're on a discussion form about muscular men in thongs all oiled up. What is gay about that
"Please don't call me that, it hurts my feelings."
Very true although if you were a hyper responder who competed and admitted couldn‚Äôt give a fuck about anything else besides winning don‚Äôt you think you‚Äôd be to concerned about injecting as much gear as you could get your mits on.
"Wrong sub homie, try posting in r/fitness or r/twinks you‚Äôll get way better response"
Dude you‚Äôre not even that tall lol
What the fuck do you expect on a bodybuilding subreddit?
Yeah i agree
"not good enough to win classic, would get crushed in 212 so... looks like third place it is!"
Biggest progress I've ever had in deadlift was when I got strong in various rows and back movements in general. That plus some nice work on Romanian DL will bring your numbers up for sure.
"No you weren‚Äôt. I get it, I‚Äôd be embarrassed too if posted cringe like that."
Like what?
"Fuck man, I really wish I didn't have such shit genetics...and also lack conviction."
Height and weight would be helpful as welll as goals. Without any of that I‚Äôd say you have muscle and a decent amount of fat.

AITA for not watching the mirror, as he unkindly mentioned, or should he be *watching where the fuck he's going*???"

Nice work!  Back even more defined.  Keep it going.

Hahah amazing
You would be surprised how easy it can be to learn some of the advanced bodyweight movements with a small amount of time and effort each day. You may well still have time for your normal weighted isolation work too.
"Totally agree. I‚Äôm not too bothered about the veins etc. But his physique is not ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù, albeit it‚Äôs very impressive and the work ethic to achieve that is amazing. But there‚Äôs no classic v-shape. He seems to have no neck. He‚Äôs so out of proportion his head looks tiny. He seems to be a poster boy to show what happens when roids are overused, starting from his exaggerated trapezius muscles. Despite this, respect. I feel bad criticising him because I know I can‚Äôt achieve 50% of what he achieved. So I feel bad dishing him."
Depends on the context. There‚Äôs a special corner of hell reserved for those who leave russet skins in a mash.
"Bro you've been spinning your wheels starving yourself and developing an eating disorder for a year now. You're young and in college, just walking to the dining hall twice per day probably puts your maintenance above most of the people here. Eat 2500 calories and do 20 minutes of cardio on upper body days. Stop starving yourself."
Crazy interesting! If you have any other info on food and gear stuff would love to hear it!
"Yeah, me too, but you don't see me doing heroin bc of that"
Literal lol
Just saw that. Shit sucks!
"Yeah, I go 100% all the time. Btw now it's gone so it's good"
"What‚Äôs wrong with a little bit of physical touching? You got a social anxiety or something? all my life I have noticed that older people often do more touching than young people. this is probably because this was not a problem back in the days. now everything is sexual assault and scary! it's just a pat on the back, as it sound.ü§î

What‚Äôs wrong with that? Starting a me2 movement for a little pat on the shoulder? ü§î"
"Really solid looking for being 17 and tall! Filling out your physique will take some time, but nail down your conditioning and presentation before the show and you should do quite well!"
I never heard that either. That's pretty strict.
"God give me Phil over Kai any day. I like it when the great ones are cocky, if anyone‚Äôs earned it it‚Äôs them. That fake deep shit is obnoxious. Kai seems like he‚Äôs been through some real shit but man his personality (on camera) is so annoying"
"Right? It‚Äôs like he took GASP promotional materials seriously and now thinks he‚Äôs some kind of badass warrior. I know literally nothing about fighting but I‚Äôm pretty sure if you‚Äôre four feet tall, have tons of chronic injuries/mobility issues, and have limited cardio capacity you‚Äôd get thrashed in a fight against pretty much anyone"
Seems retarded. When youre doing seated db press your elbows are supposed to be slightly towards one another not 90degrees. Better piece of advice is that you dont even need to over head press anything your shoulders will blow up doing accessory work

"Just use straps. 

It's hard to tell from this angle, is your shoulder joint directly above the bar when you are pulling? You don't want to get 'ahead' of the bar. Your hips are probably fine though, unless you need to move your torso back to get directly over the bar in which case they might need to drop a tiny bit."
You are one beautiful sum'bitch.
"Sounds good yeah, at least for the mental part of not struggling with things like the thought of ""hey I'd eat this but I know I can't"". Guess you're at that point where your body somehow doesn't want to grow more, seems something common amongst guys that get to that level."
ok thank you
That's currently ruining me man. 2 years. She's at the gym at the same time as me right now
"oh man, asking for advice then talking shit to people who give advice.

What a knob"
If all you have is 3 days and want to do glutes just do heavy high reps squats and hip thrusts 3x a week. Strong thicc ass and legs in no time.

He used his grandfathers death for clout. This isn't surprising. The best thing to do would to NOT bring him up or post his clips here. Any attention good or bad only feeds him. Ignore and let him yell from the distance like the irrelevance he is and stay focused on remembering the good person that John was.

"You literally agree with me, only problem is I don't take anything and never have. If I were to get more respect and less shit on, why in the world would I lie.

"Good luck man.  While its obvious you started using something after looking back at your pics from 1 year ago, its never easy to admit publicly what you use when you are a 19 year old so I forgive you lol.  I don't forgive this sub for being this dumb tho

but yeah, natty achievable? yeah def, some sketch stuff on the traps/shoulders, but its the 1 year gains that you made that make it obvious besides your shoulders.  its just silly to try to lie tho but its what most young guys or people trying to be influencers do"
"It's very tragic that he died--regardless of the cause--but he's kinda got a point. The last thing the bbing community needs is more smog from gear-related deaths.

Although, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for there to be some regulations to protect the health of competitors. I'm strictly addressing the stigma surrounding bbing"
"so top 3 olympia is just ""give up and switch divisions"" ???"
Probably a lack of some other unmentionables as well...
The initial lift was good bro. You want to make sure that you follow the same range of motion on your down also though. You used your lower back a lot by leaning forward when you finished your rep and that can cause injury.
"&gt; just the obvious continue to lose the fat, and put on as much muscle as you can

well I was trying to bulk up a bit but I suppose it is time soon to switch to cutting."

I mean this man probably played sports too on the before working out so he was probably in good shape to begin with on the left. Add extremely gifted genetics and the gym in and you get that result. Really not that hard to believe lol
"Sugar free ketchup, hot sauce, seasoning etc. they taste like nothing so you can flavor it however."
Impressive
Yeah I saw those calories last time he posted and as a 6‚Äô2‚Äù dude my jaw dropped. He must feel like absolute shit rn.
Wow.  This is a bit one sided in almost every category.
Nice
Grab some heavy dumbbells and do some partial rep side lateral swings.

"Dude is super busy right now. Between the new baby, the gym, massive influx of clients, YouTube, and the apparel side of the business, he's got his plate full. He does a lot of this himself too, not sure how much his brother is involved anymore."

That was easily by far the weirdest tangentially-bodybuilding-related thing I have ever seen.

"Sick progress man, nice job there! Only thing I'd consider is the training frequency, if you prefer to do 6 days make sure you don't overdo the volume. Also, it's probably time to up the calories a bit and see how your body responds. Keep killing it!"

"Had something strange happen. I was at home, wrapping up the workday when I heard keys jingling from someone trying to get into my apartment, which is odd since I live alone. I figured they just absent-mindedly went to the wrong apartment, so I just waited for them to stop. She said she was trying to get into my apartment, to which I asked why? She laughed, thinking I was joking, and kept trying, so I got up and looked through the peephole. She even said that I sounded like the person she was trying to visit. I opened the door so that she could see that I wasn't whoever she was looking for. I figured she must have the apartment number right, but was probably looking for the building next door or across the street, and told her that.

She was pretty hot. Because I'm not Johnny Sins, and this is real life, that's all that happened. Tbh, this made me realize how lonely I am."
Good bot
Que lol
"PT started immediately after. Doctor cleared maximal effort 12 weeks post surgery. Didnt to previous weights until 16-18 weeks after


Pretty much did pt as recommended daily. Then did dumbbell press 3x a week, 3x20 each time. Week 1 was 5lb and increased 5lb each week. So 3 workouts with the same weight before increasing"
bagels are great i get the ones from sams club the everything bagels. 300 calories and macros aren‚Äôt too bad either
Portland hipsters sound way better than the ones we got over here on the east coast. Not uncommon to find them putting dogs on vegan diets and not even giving them vitamins or anything. Our hipsters aren‚Äôt even *good* at hipstering.

Nope. 12:30 tryna wind down after psyching myself up to write that cover letter and submit my app. Why my brain. Why."
Nobody here is saying his physique is bad. It‚Äôs the fact that he lies about his steroid use. You‚Äôre active in the natty or juice sub and that says a lot about you.
"My weakness is thick thighs, a fat ass, &amp; weird women bc I'm autistic &amp; weird."
Very impressive.

I‚Äôve just started going gym again so don‚Äôt wanna stop working out. I‚Äôm ok for legs, biceps and traps, I can do them fine.
But for back, chest and triceps what exercises can I do that don‚Äôt stress the rotator cuff?
Any help would be greatly appreciated"

"Strawman fallacy. Just because I disagree with lockdowns doean't mean I disagree with everything else.
I often get the seatbelt argument. Seatbelt don't prevent you from driving, they don't slow your car down, they are therefore not a big price to pay for a net benefit.
Lockdowns on the other hand are an immense price to pay for an minor if not non existent benefit. We did not know that in March of 2020 be we now have data to show us that they do not achieve the desired effect but create a terrible environment for almost everyone that is not extremely privileged to not have their lives affected.

And I'm not American, I'm French an I live in Australia where 1 positive case send a whole state into lockdown."

If I was to compete which would never happen because I‚Äôm a 400lb fat white guy, but if I was, I would get those dorm decoration lights from Amazon and they change colour so you can save money because if you put them on your posing trunks they can change the look for the prejudging and the night show. Also make sure the show has good bathrooms to do Coke in to drop the last film of water. Just be careful my friend almost died doing that back in the day. Cheers."
Thanks a lotüòÑ
I‚Äôm sure if he stepped out a time machine he would see the competition and come thru conditioned like nobody‚Äôs business.

You have weak muscles and you have strong muscles. Make your weak muscles stronger to match your strong muscles.

Yeah no doubt. Just need to push past mental and physical barriers to bring the best package I can and let the judges decide where I deserve to be

"&gt; I'd think IFBB would want to transition towards a better production experience for viewership as livestreams and PPV sales increase, right? 

That'd happen if they put some money into improving those resources and making them the best they can, then marketing them well. They don't seem to have caught up to the modern day quite fully yet or are blind to the amount of cash they can make through that some fucking how.

I dunno, what do I know, I'm just talking shit on the Internet. Just how it seems to me /shrug"
Definitely need to start doing somewhat intense cardio again :(
Urs and him are pretty comparable IMO. Also both on the same team and both Pros since 2020.
Yes it's correct. An injury heals better when you're not in a deficit.

"Yeah man, i had terrible puberty gyno and the only way to hide them was growing muscles around them. But now its time to take it up a notch and actually get huge lol."
"Yeah I‚Äôve done them a few different ways. My favorite is to come in the morning and do 6-10 sets of one or two heavy compounds, and come back in the evening for your pump work. What you‚Äôre saying also works fine. The important part is eating a shitload of food and potentially getting a nap between your sessions."
Big Lenny Mr O 2021 no doubt
"Meh, don't really care. Dude was a pretty well known piece of shit"
"And you know what the worst part is? My abs *weren't* even that functional. They let me do big compounds (I could brace fairly well), but when I had to do things that required gymnastics-like abdominal control, I was absolutely terrible."
Haha thanks no I didn‚Äôt mean I just casually did 475lbs for 8 haha. I meant lb
It‚Äôs true. I put my foot under his ass to do my set and when I was done I got up and she bashed him hard with her bag. I laughed as stinky cheese man glared at us as if somehow we were in the wrong.
"If it's comfortable and not causing any knee/hip/low back discomfort, then your current form is fine, especially for a newer lifter. Working on proper bracing in the core and upper back will help you stay tight and upright in the hole.

After you have been lifting for a while, you can start to play around with bar position, heel elevation (squat shoes), and other things to stay more upright if you want to."
"Bodybuilders live way past 40.  Hell dorian Yates is 59,  dexter Jackson is 51 and still competing if I‚Äôm not mistaken and Kai Greene is 46 as well as Shawn Rhoden.

You guys must be fun at parties

"Why would a forearm increase punching power when it comes from delts, back and hips?"
Sounds like some serious ad hoc rationalization. Large breasts don't lead to better survival of childbirth or breast milk producing capabilities for example. Just because something sounds correct does not mean it is.
"I have seen an insane amount of growth on Gamma Bomb. Going to keep bulking through the end of the year when we run 28 Days Later. Then, going to start cutting around Jan./Feb. Still plenty of room for improvement. But I am excited to see what physique comes out on the other side."
100% true. Your whole body will be electric and your lifts will kick ass

thanks buddy! but they don‚Äôt ship to an APO address either :‚Äô(
Yes and yes. However I don‚Äôt drink coffee after 10am and don‚Äôt have preworkout after 5pm otherwise I have issues sleeping.
"Unfortunate genetics?  You should try to die with that ""gap"" and a measly vastly pronounced beautiful only a four pack.

Fuck! the guy died @ 63!"
"Overtraining, no, but possibly overreaching. If you are experiencing muscle fatigue or other physical recovery problems, then you should probably reduce the sets per session. IMO this is preferable to keeping the same volume but reducing the RPE, as legs respond very well to high intensity.

However, if your muscles feel fine physically, and it's only a psychological problem, then it *might* not be indicative of overreaching. If this is the case, the better solution might actually be to work on your mindset - don't go killing yourself or anything, but try to turn some of the anxiety into excitement and anticipation."
That hurts my soul
I straight up thought this was Robocop from the icon.
"it's ridiculous, to be honest. they remove so many posts related to training/prioritization while others comment with ""r/fitness"", but mods completely fail to put up a thread where many of the questions could be addressed.

maybe I'm just having a bad day, I don't know"
"Arms and shoulders look pretty good, from this angle I would highly recommend chest and abs - for chest I think you should be doing every angle of bench press HEAVY; incline, flat and decline. And also every angle of cables as heavy as you can with control. For abs, I highly recommend starting with hanging leg raises to get your lower V line to start showing, this will also require oblique focus so look up exercises for obliques as well."
Ok. What‚Äôs your insta?
Leaving humanity behind.. it‚Äôs the only option ;)
"No sorry man I appreciate the feedback I fully agree my legs are my weak link by far. My stats/numbers don‚Äôt look so bad so I am hoping if I can bring up definition like I intend to it‚Äôll make the 27.5‚Äù size show a bit better. I agree they need a lot of work, though.

Yes he was suppose to be animals main guy back when centopani got hurt &amp; animal was the biggest name in hardcore bodybuilding/powerlifting rather than redcon1. Been following him for a long time and unfortunately his career really never went anywhere but he certainly is a fucking freak.
He looks good but I don't think he's conditioned enough to win
You have great fucking taste. These are two of my favs
"Yes. Every muscle has an insertion point. It‚Äôs just not as important for shoulders. Bone structure and your muscle fascia matter a lot more for those. If you have a naturally narrow frame then your shoulder likely won‚Äôt look that good. The muscle fascia is what holds all your muscle fibres in place and gives them their shape. They‚Äôre chiefly responsible for the shape of literally every muscle you have and are incredibly important. They‚Äôre the same thing that gives some people ridiculous bicep peaks, while people like me are stuck with Chris Bumstead‚Äôs flatter and fatter bicep shape."
hat to do at the end of a cutting phase to minimize weight and fat regain? Change daily kcal into maintenance or do a slow reverse diet? (weekly increase of?)
"Snapped out of my bullshit. Lost 8.5 pounds the last week. No boozing this week and will be quitting vaping this week as well. 
From the beginning of the pandemic till now I completely stopped lifting and body building and hit the bottle hard. Last week I noticed fat rolls under what used to be my pecs.  That was simply too much.  I cut my calories and boozing. Seeing my weight go down was a big motivational pivot point. I have goals. I‚Äôm back. I‚Äôm hitting the iron hard this week. I have a purpose. I guess my rock bottom was fat rolls under my tits. It was soul crushing to realize what I‚Äôve become. I truly look awful but I have purpose and a real mission. 

Mind you this post is bullshit unless I consistently lift not half ass and  not with a guilty ego this week."
:(
"A lot of professional sports are unhealthy.  Professional bodybuilding is not something you pursue if you want to maximize longevity or health. It's to push one more limit of human ability (alongside sports that push the limits of speed, strength, power, endurance, toughness, combat).  If that's the bar, then we'd have to get rid of NFL (or any sport where pushing to such massive body size isdone), NHL, all forms of professional fighting, ultra marathoning, and a bunch of others."
"I just have pretty wide hip bones. Not a big deal when I‚Äôm sitting at 205lbs cause it fills in with fat, but when I cut to anything below 198 I start to get an hour glass like figure. 

Would like to lean out more, but it means the fat that gives me symmetry will disappear.

I figure if I can cut the fat and build the muscle I will maintain that symmetry."
Yeah man wtf how does he look that good and have an ass backwards front double bi
Kinda sad that people are going through strangers' accounts. Like you dont even know the guy so why the fuck does it matter what they've posted before.

"Honestly I think the biggest thing that separates intermediate/advanced lifters from beginners is the ability to filter stuff out and just get after it. When you realize that you have a pretty good sense of what works for *you*, and you don‚Äôt start changing up your routine/meal plan based off shit you read on the internet, you‚Äôll probably start to see the best progress of your life. Doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt still have questions, of course"

"He's in shape, but he definitely wouldn't be the biggest guy at my gym."
Good for him he other guy. Sincerely. Hope he gets the mileage such a hog deserves. Gonna guess he has no problems in that area.
I do work to failure on almost every set. Maximum damage seems to occur with me when doing BFR deadlifts. Maybe rhabo is why they are called deadlifts...

Looks fucking awesome. Big triceps really make the arms look so much better in most poses. He'll do well in the IFBB with a good coach.

"So positive nitrogen balance indicates that the body is in an anabolic state and not that it prickers the body to go into an anabolic state?

Everyone in here saying he fucked up his body due to lifting‚Ä¶ obviously SOME truth to it. BUT Ronnie a few years ago came out saying the reason he cannot walk is a degenerative disease he would‚Äôve gotten anyway been in his family for generations and it was a main reason he lifted the way he did.

yes!!!!!  :)

"I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I‚Äôll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion."
"Yeah set up will cost more, I‚Äôd say go to a gym for a while and save up for the barbell, rack, bench and weights. Going to the gym as a novice is really nice for keeping you going. I don‚Äôt have an argument against dumbells since basically any form of resistance training will build strength and size for a novice, but the basic barbell compound movements will build both more efficiently than anything else"
"Yeah thank you. These other comments are like ""James messed up by not doing the Arnold!"" Okay... And so you're saying Brandon and Hadi messed up by not doing the Arnold also? ""Well no they have no reason to! They are already qualified for the O"" ... And James wasn't? ""You obviously don't know anything about bodybuilding.""

Seems like some people just regurgitate what they heard even if there's no logic behind it.

On the other hand, you have James' coach admitting that he had him peaked too early then they were screwed. Now if James did the Arnold, you might even speculate that he would've been WORSE off for the O due to even earlier peaking, OR he would've messed up the peak for that show then had enough time to recover and come in better for the O. Either way, absolutely no evidence that skipping the Arnold hurt (or helped) James in any way, but if you learn from the reigning Mr. O champs over the years, it's clear that doing no other show and focusing 100% of your energy on that one show is the best approach for the very top/upper echelon."
I'm only on day 2. But I really enjoyed it. I got a lot more activation on some of the exercises either because they were different or because i wasn't so gassed from everything before

"I‚Äôll answer this in good faith, despite knowing better: yes, American doctors were incentivized to prescribe opioids to patients and mislead them about the potential for addiction.

Opioid companies also bought off medical publications to publish *peer reviewed* research stating that opioids were just fine, not addictive at all, great for pain management, etc. 

In a totally unrelated phenomenon, doctors that want to publish pro-trans research today are paid to do so by the Pritzker Foundation."

"Clusters feel better in compounds for me, in a similar fashion to rest pauses. Part of the purpose of those techniques is to do a similar amount of effective reps in less time due to less rest time. Isolation exercises already have low rest times usually, I'd rather do dropsets or another intensity technique there. It's very personal tho, and different exercises may feel better with one technique or other."

"Honestly, you probably don't even need all that if you don't want. It's pretty well established at this point that sets in the 5-30ish rep range get you similar enough hypertrophy outcomes so long as you're taking the sets to the same proximity to failure. It's probably not totally optimal due to differing twitch fibres and general novelty and such, but you can still build a great physique on very high reps with lower weight."
Honestly a shitty barbell and some weights is like $50. Requires such little space &amp; you can do so much.

"&gt; There's no evidence to support either argument except anecdotal reports.

Right but the burden of proof is on whoever is making the claim (that reverse dieting improves body comp).

&gt;In that case you'd be better off moving into a surplus and gradually reducing cardio to increase that surplus until youre at a maintainable calorie balance (output vs input). 

Right, I'm not disagreeing that they should go into a surplus here. My point is if you gradually ramp up your surplus, you will *appear* to have leaner gains in the short term relative to someone who immediately jumps to their full bulking calories. But what I'm stressing is the reason for that is that you spent time at a very low caloric surplus, which inherently yields leaner gains (at the expense of slow weight gain). The leaner gains are a direct function of a smaller surplus, not some unsubstantiated metabolic adaptation where a very lean body is ""primed"" to put on fat at a higher rate than if it was at a higher bodyfat %"

"Slow and steady is totally fine and great!

But counterpoint: I can start my deficit at 500. Or 750. Or 1000. In any case, there is room to make changes. I can always add more cardio/pull calories/etc., it's just the deficit is larger. It doesn't matter where you start.

Like to do deadlifts and squats on the same day twice a week. Usually do squats first though because deadlifts exhaust my body so much.

"I wish I had some more results going further back, been looking into it more and maybe this explains some other stuff. I've had a lot of energy/fatigue issues before and some mood changes. Tried meds for a bit for couple different things in my 20's but that never seemed to help. Honestly if those areas are mainly from low T and improve on trt. Don't really care about the building better phsyique as much as the overall quality of life improvement like you said. It's been a drag for awhile and the gym was a measure at first to try and combat those since not much else was helping."
Thanks so much man ! Keep up the great work
Couple other guys looked better imo. Good videos on YouTube from prejudging. Good for him tho
"So I‚Äôm getting tired of freezer veggies but they‚Äôre SO cost effective. Most cost effective part of my diet. 1$ bag of broccoli is one day of veggies.

I‚Äôve been thinking I wanna start having cold finger food veggies like tomatoes, but not sure how to go about it. Are there any cost effective like‚Ä¶ I guess precut containers of a bunch of veggies? I could buy platters and portion them? Seems expensive though. I‚Äôd like to keep my monthly vegetable costs below 50$

Any ideas welcome. Main goal is not having to microwave crap and eat soggy sad veggies 4 meals a day, 7 days a week"
Most people that died are like really big and low bodyfat they might have run stupid doses too. Back in those days they didn't have the info we have. You can't blame them for running that but most if us probably don't have to worry with our 500mg test cycles and maybe + one injectable. Some pro cycles are really stupid it's not hard to find examples of people running almost everything at once then yes ur fucked
Yeah where do you think the term comes from??

"Yeah definitely, but I‚Äôve been doing 3-6 min rests for many years and wanted to try some more BB style training, was just very surprised about how much weight I had to drop to get there"

"I say get a coach if you‚Äôre serious long term. I had a coach who was an IFBB pro and it made the prep very smooth, especially the last few weeks where water manipulation comes into play. 

Aside from that, do everything you can to maintain muscle. Assuming you‚Äôre natural, it‚Äôs very easy to get skinny instead of ripped if you cut things too drastically / add too much volume.  

Big thing is enjoy the process!!! Teen physique isn‚Äôt extremely large base, so you may run uncontested, or may go against people who shouldn‚Äôt be competing, or may go against people who really should be in men‚Äôs physique, so doing what you can to enjoy the process regardless of the outcome it very important IMO"

My question is, do I try to add more arm excercises to the end of each day, or do I add a specific arm day? Was thinking about redoing the program but do a PPAL type of split mainly because my arms get so worn out from the larger body group excercises. This way I'd add more focus on arm growth. Do any of you have experience and/or advice on what I should do?"

"Since WFH last March, I usually drink a scoop of G-Fuel every morning (I hate coffee and this is my wake-up drink - plus they have some really tasty flavours). I used to always do a scoop of pre-workout before my workout as well, a habit I picked up a couple years ago and would always do it when I got home from work because I was usually exhausted. Recently I started making myself a smoothie about an hour before my workout. Been putting my creatine in that instead of my pre and now have dropped doing preworkout altogether. Starting to feel like I don't really need it anymore and now I can save it for the days where I'm super tired."

I lowered calories too quickly and have ended up without anywhere to to tbh.

"Training to failure gives you the most stimulus for muscle growth, but at the cost of outsized fatigue accumulation. If you always do it, over time this will result in burnout or injury if you don't give yourself a week or two of super easy pussy training or even complete rest every few months. This is especially true for big, compound movements. Staying 1 or 2 reps shy of failure in most of your training gives the best ratio of stimulus to fatigue. Of course you should KNOW what failure means for each movement, so it's fine to go to failure every once in a while, at the end of a training cycle, right before you deload and give yourself some time to recover fully before a new cycle."

"Gamma Bomb does use progressive overload, just not in terms of weight on the bar. The progression is by adding volume every week."
"""good genetics"" IMO mean 4 things in no particular order:

1) muscle shape (e.g. long/short biceps, ab symmetry, etc.).

2) Training response, i.e. how much your muscles grow in mass for a given amount of effort.

3) drug response, i.e. how much benefit you get from a given dose of a given performance enhancing drug.

4) fat loss response, i.e. how fast can you lose fat without your mood/energy tanking and how much muscle you retain at a certain fat loss rate.

Personally, I also think there's a huge genetic component to the psychological aspect of bodybuilding, but that's more controversial and usually not something people think about when they speak of ""good genetics""."

"Had a similar issue, best exercises for me was YTIW‚Äôs, deep neck flexion, shoulder blade retraction squeezers, and an exercise i call snow angels. For the last one, lay on your stomach and put your arms fully extended out in front of you above your head with your palms facing the floor. As you keep your arms extended, slowly move your arms in a circular motion toward the sides while slowing turning your hands to the ceiling and squeeze hard at the bottom. Let me know if you have any questions i can‚Äôt find a video of the last one"

In like 99% of cases gyno can be fixed only with surgery unless you treat it with drugs as it's developing. After it's formed then it's over.
Small aside - how the hell do the classic guys keep their waists so trim compared to everything else? Limited oblique training and not going super heavy to get that strongman barrel gut?
"Lol, the point is you are speculating about drug use, you don‚Äôt know, so in turn it‚Äôs not fair to speculate any further, you don‚Äôt know anything and prove your own comment wrong."
"No worries in my end! I understood what you meant and why you saw it that way. 

For your second part though‚Ä¶ I appreciate the kind words, but that was kind of an odd insertion of your assumption. Nowhere in my response did I insinuate or associate a decrease in the value of my own progress in comparison to someone else‚Äôs. I was comparing my progress as a natty 22 year old ~10 years ago to this 22 year old competitor who has likely quite a bit of exogenous influence. I‚Äôm very happy with how far I‚Äôve come."

"I hope he didn‚Äôt suffer. Yeah, his choices may have caught up to him or he could have had an underlying, undiagnosed condition that prematurely ended his life; nonetheless, what bodybuilders do is impressive and yea, extreme, and unhealthy. We should, as a community, have a conversation about the unhealthy aspects of the sport."
"Sarms definitely work, just don't do them as a noobie (or any PED, for that matter). They carry all the same risks as steroids such as gyno, acne, hair loss, etc."
"If I *really* want to know who is stronger, I think that I'd need a lot of information about someone's lifts to determine who is stronger.  I'd need 1 rep maxes of a LOT of different exercises (not just ""the big 3""), different grip types, lots of different rep ranges (with different tempos), and even some random things like isometric holds.  So I agree that 1 rep maxes are overrated for comparison purposes.

But since that's impossible and people just love to make comparisons, 1 rep maxes are generally the simplest way to compare two lifts.  

Also, 1 rep maxes are generally when my technique is actually the best and I think that's how a lot of lifters are."
It deff has but the more physiques like this you get competing the more we might see a swing to a truly classic aesthetic.  This guys body is undeniably well proportioned and adding size over time will only make it more competitive.  Looks diced but still healthy and strong.  I'm so fucking impressed.

"It's necessary because you are focused on macros. 

I really wish you'd read that book, it covers a lot of things about the food you eat, but the big focus is that organic food IS almost laways more nutrient dense than non-organic food, not to mention the biggest factor is no pesticides or factors that could potentially get you sick via cancer or other long term ailment.  

The GMO part doesnt matter, I mean, literally every single thing we eat is the crossbred/domesticated nonwild version of the plant, but the thing about non-organic food is its less nutrient dense and can be potentially harmful via carcinogenics.

This is like the difference between getting your macros from a Big Mac or a homemade grilled chicken and broccoli dish."

The reason why i don‚Äôt weigh a shit ton is because of my torso and bf%. I have a pretty average height torso with very long arms and legs.  My shoulders are super wide but my stomach abdominal area is very short and thin which is a big factor in weight. I‚Äôm also not sure if I have light bones or what but my brother who is 6‚Äô2 and has very little muscle at all as he doesn‚Äôt lift and is pretty skinny weighs more than me. And his bf isn‚Äôt high he‚Äôs just a heavy guy. I‚Äôve always been lean I‚Äôve never cut calories in my life.
Wow. Honored to be confused for Kai. Thank you
I put 3g of salt in my intra. You‚Äôre fine
I am super excited to try 225lb squats in a week or so which is exciting because it would be the first time squaring over 200 since I had a disc herniation like 1.5yrs ago that stole all my motivation for lifting until about a month back. Even though I tweaked my back 2 weeks ago (on fuckin 135lb hip thrust of all things) I found that squats don‚Äôt aggravate it. I know 225 isn‚Äôt much but having had a 3plate in my sights to nothing due to injury this is huge for me. I am also lighter than I have been since like jr high.

"&gt;gay new Greg fad

  honestly yeah, probably

  He basically seems to be old school hi pro, hi carb, low fat combined with IIFYM, as such probably views whole eggs as being too calorie dense overall.

  Which to be fair, if you start consuming more then 2-3 per day they can add up fairly quickly, but yeah, all the actual good nutrition from the egg is actually in the yolk.  

  Winds up being a beef VS chicken breast type of thing.  Beef is much higher in nutrients, but tends to be fattier.  Chicken breast is basically all protein and so can hit the protein macro easier while keeping overall calories down.

  Now where all this shit really doesn't make sense to my mind is people that go the chicken, egg white route, but then deliberately add ""healthy fats"" in the way of olive oil, peanut butter, avocados to the point where they could just be eating beef and eggs instead and getting higher quality protein sources."

"muscle growth is much faster then corresponding connective tissue (tendons + ligament) growth.  Learned this when I got into bouldering and rockclimbing.  It takes a muscle 1 month to gain what it would take a tendon 6 months, and ligaments even longer (due to blood supply).  Its a time thing, that means patience.  Also try things like yoga which are great for connective tissue and joint strengthening specifically- isometric holds."

I'm sure you can figure out what it is if you take an honest look at things."

Yea my bad I didn't specifically mean him I was exaggerating the mantra I've seen some people follow. I appreciate the response!

The wiki is kinda old on the sub but is the 16 week cycle still the preferred method? Seems like a lot of people are on mild cruises year round and blast whenever they want."
Orthopedic pillows look a weird shape but they're great for your neck and real comfortable.
"Slow high reps very low weight when getting back into it imo. Feel the lactic acid burn, not your body struggling to move heavy weight. You'll be back to your normal self in time, don't fuckup your joints moving as heavy as possible just cause you can. Not sure if this helps you didn't specify much in terms of movement choices."

Looking good man! I would agree with the tri comments but you are still balanced right now. How's the back?
Yes. I always felt bad because my husband tries to explain his job or his investments to me and I just blank out after awhile and nothing makes sense anymore. Good to know I‚Äôm not stupid. My brain just sucks at listening and focusing.
Dude you look solid for 18 and especially one year in.
Don‚Äôt forget about Breon he‚Äôs looking like a monster
"True, true."
Fantastic build!  Keep us updated as you progress in your prep!
"That‚Äôs not how it works lol, your pay is tax free and you get some bonuses, but you aren‚Äôt getting 60k per year unless you‚Äôre either an officer(gone to college) or married(which means that money is also paying for your family at home) and there‚Äôs no bonus for going more than 1 time.  The pay is nice over there, but it‚Äôs not going to make you rich.

I‚Äôm sorry to say, but it‚Äôs very very unlikely we‚Äôll be in iraq in 6 years, and if we are it‚Äôs going to be a tiny handful.  I was supposed to go to Afghanistan this year and they canceled that 18 months ago."

maybe try a lower intensity cardio for longer. also could try doing it separate from lifting so you arent as tired.

"Honestly this isn't the majority of the issue. This alone wouldn't kill someone at 46. It's the extreme dehydration, diuretics, PEDs, extreme caloric deficit, micronutrient imbalances, AND the fact that they're holding a lot of muscle. I just wish people would wake the fuck up, and change the sport for the better. There needs to be hydration tests, blood work, etc. put in place to compete. Similar to other sports where weight cutting cause injury such as combat sports. This sport has gotten to the point where it's causing extreme lasting injury to competitor's bodies, when it's supposed to show the ""ideal"" physique. Why don't we take health into account?"
"If your back looks like baki, that means you played through the gym."

"Idk how it‚Äôs sexist to be curious if women with muscle mass that would put them in the top 0.001% of men with much higher testosterone are one steroids. If anything, I was trying not to be sexist by assuming maybe genetics could explain. 

Btw, how risky is anavar? Would it shut down natural testosterone production?"
Makes sense. Would support that as well.
"Good advice for like 5% of the population.

Most dudes objectively look better with nice hair."
"I highly doubt they are going to try and exactly match the proportions.

Additionally it‚Äôs not like having a tight waist is strictly exclusive to classic at all. Having a tight midsection is just part of bodybuilding as a whole, hence why dudes get shit on when they struggle with it (Phil Heath for example)."
"Is this an American problem I'm too european to understand? Just because your country has a messed up healthcare system that rips off people who have their life at risk doesn't make every doctor in the world a drug dealer, sorry, US isn't the entire world."
"Agreed on all counts. It's like when someone with terrible genetics gives it 150%

Better music.
"Honest and naive question : he's helping a bit at the beginning of the movement with his back, giving some momentum that makes it easier for the biceps. Wouldn't this specific exercice be more effective if he doesn't do that ?"
Not all of them are genetic freaks like you'd think. Some are just freaks that respond to steroids extremely well. Not all genetic freaks respond to androgens very well. Obviously this is different but I know some amateurs near me that have responded to roids CRAZY WELL. Like you wouldn't think they were the same person on and off cycle.
Eh he's got a good peak but his insertions arent the best on his biceps
"Basically the difference between a perfect temperature and being a fucking sweaty mess haha. Although can see how Fahrenheit make some sense, what kills me is the distance units."

I know that historically bodybuilding/powerlifting/oly/lifting in general have been more working class/lower status sports or hobbies and that's honestly not something that bothers me at all because I enjoy training

But has anyone else felt like the COVID epidemic has made lifting communities unbearable? It's like as soon as COVID hit, all these lifting communities turned into full on anti-vaxx, anti-mask, pro-conspiracy theory circles which honestly is making the whole lifting social space unbearable as a whole"

"I'd love to see what my body could do in the gym after like a week or a month of actually getting enough sleep lol, I'd like to know what difference it makes."

"Those look alright; give them a shot for a few weeks and see what kind of results you are getting and how you feel. If you want more leg or more upper body work in a week, consider switching to an upper/lower split, and you can train the priority muscle group twice in a week a little harder, and the lower priority group once but very intensely."
Paused barbell squats and dumbbell split squats are a good way to train stabilization without needing any specific exercise.
"/u/Tootrillbih is trying to [make fun of me](https://i.imgur.com/q9qwdb4.jpg) for deadlifting ‚Äúonly‚Äù 405 pounds. For sets of 8. A year after my open heart surgery. Of which beforehand I deadlifted [545 pounds](https://instagram.com/p/BnoqQQbHO6O/) or 3.5x my BW 

Wanted to publicly call out his fatass. Mad because I said he‚Äôs hallucinating for saying he‚Äôs gaining muscle after he said he eats no protein, eats a bunch, and doesn‚Äôt even workout.

"Transitioning is like the final 1% of a score if that. In regional/nationals they‚Äôll actually cut you down for having overly flashy or too long of transitions. Pros get more leeway because well, they‚Äôre pros. If you tried some of the pro men‚Äôs physique transitions at an NPC show the head judge will call you out in front of everyone and tell you to stop. It happens a few times a year.

If someone nails the mandatories 5% better than you and has zero transitions, literally just turns into the next pose, and you have amazingly smooth transitions, you‚Äôll place below them.

Go to an NPC hosted posing clinic before ever competing. They‚Äôre free and they‚Äôll tell you all of this. They‚Äôll explicitly tell first time competitors to forget about transitions entirely and focus on mandatories when practicing 100%"

whats with the almost complete lack of delt striations among pro open bodybuilders even in stage condition? Even twink natties at 10% bf have better delt striations. Is it because of SEOs or something to do with GH and Insulin? There's so little separation between the delts and pecs too (and elsewhere too)
"Lmao, but why? He‚Äôs got gains no?"
"Good point! Favre killed it with S1 of the Mandalorian and of course, Iron Man. I think Mandalorian S2 wasn't as much of a banger for me as it relied more on the Jedi (and lightsabres) deus ex machina, if it were kept to just Ahsoka featured in that one episode, that would've been fine. Using the force and force users to deus ex machina is lazy writing, imo. It's something used all the time in Star Wars. ""Oh no she isnt dead, because she's secretly mary poppins/jedi!"" 

Now one argument could be, ""well this story is made for kids."" That would be true about the originally movie, or the cartoon shows maybe, but the target audience for star wars in 2015 - now is very much age 3 to the grave."
Yeah it's pretty sad. The guys on this stage look incredible. Today is just a freak show of a very small minority with the right combo of genetics and mental illness who are willing to take ridiculous amounts of all sorts of drugs.

"I know fuck all about posing so keep that in mind, but I've seen talk of sorta rolling your left shoulder forward and towards the viewer a bit to bring the left pec more 'curved' around to face the viewer somewhat, too, and makes your chest look fucking huge from the viewers perspective.

I dunno...I'm explaining that terribly. Have a look at a bunch of Olympia level side chest shots to see what I mean. It displays your whole chest from the side rather than mostly just seeing the right pec. I may also be talking shit and misunderstanding the pose but y'know"

You look great especially the quads.
"If I can hit 10 x 3 for a certain exercise, say 10 sets of 3 squats @ 275, would it better to just move up and try to do 10 sets of 3 at 285 (for all 10 sets), or break it down so I do 9 x 3 @ 275, 1 x 3 @ 285, then if I can do that - move up to 8 x 3 @ 275, 2 x 3 @ 285, etc. and repeat over and over for the rest of my life"

I sneak up to the treadmill next to him and give him a snarky ‚Äúsup dude?!‚Äù He smiles bright and big and me and goes ‚ÄúDUDE, I figured out if I only let myself watch anime at the gym I‚Äôll actually go!‚Äù I look down and he has DBZ going on his phone and two hours clocked on the treadmill.

"Depends on how much fatigue I have, usually I'll do the elliptical or if I have more energy, indoor cycling, as well as at least 10k steps daily. If you have no joint issues running is great, you can burn a shit ton of calories in little time and it's really enjoyable!"

"Sometimes I imagine ridiculous scenarios that make me laugh. There's a couple of lifting-related ones I came up with:

1. Guy who takes his own barbell to the gym every day that looks like a real Olympic bar but only weighs 25-30 lbs. Yes, someone would go through all that effort just to look like he's lifting 15-20 more lbs than he actually is.

2. Guy on a bodybuilding forum/subreddit repeatedly posts pics of his scale showing how much he weighs, but never posts pictures of his physique, or even proof that it's him standing on the scale without holding something to inflate his weight. Brags about weighing X number of pounds, but his actual weight, physique, and body composition is a mystery."

Ive messed around with 300 test/ 500 tren, sides were fucked and felt like I was winded just from eating. Dosed again at 500 test/500 tren, aggression was amplified and I would get pissed just going to the market for groceries. Then switched to what Ive been on for the past 3 weeks at 750 test/300 tren MWF pinning schedule and Ive liked it a lot tbf.

Being blunt you are overweight. All your issues stem from being overweight (why tf would u do liposuction). The answer to your questions are you are in a surplus. Your chest will look much much better at lower body fats. Count your calories and eat less and you'll get the results you want.

How long ago was it? And gotta save that video to show people what it takes to grow big legs. Too many people not pushing it nearly enough and wondering why they‚Äôre legs are small
Sadly for now i dont have a spotter but especially in dumbbell press the last rep is me dropping the weights or pushing it with all my life. Ofcourse with spotter helping me several kilos i can make 2-3 more reps but by myself m really sure im on the limit. I cant say the same about benchpress because im alone i dont risk a lot incase of me getting stuck under the bar.

You post great content on the forum but when it comes to your comments... They seem a little immature and rash. If you post a pic and someone criticizes you on reddit of all places.... don't attack and make assumptions about their body.  Quit lifting weight unproductively and pick up a fricken book.

"So, straight up taking testosterone for bodybuilding is illegal in the United States. Neither the professionals in this sub, or over in /r/steroids, will give you a source on where to get gear on the open forum as this is illegal where many of the active posters live.   


What you will want to do is to check out one of the many TRT clinics that are open in the country. They are EVERYWHERE in California, and a lot of them advertise online. All of them will have you do blood-work first so they can get a baseline of your free testosterone, total test, estradiol, thyroid, cholesterol, and liver values, along with other metabolic markers. The more shady of the clinics may only do a hormone panel. Be wary of those. All exogenous testosterone will impact your cholesterol, as HDL cholesterol is one of the precursors for building testosterone in our bodies. (Someone with more biochem in their history may want to correct me on that if I'm wrong.) This should be followed up by a Skype or Zoom call with a doctor who will go over your values and personal history and decide on your therapeutic dosage.   


Good luck!"

"Yes. 

It‚Äôs happened with the original h1n1 strand in 1918-1920 known as the Spanish flu.

Lesson learned for myself: this time around I‚Äôm going to keep weighing myself every morning even after I end my cut because it‚Äôs so easy for me to lie to myself and think that I‚Äôm not putting on pounds, especially when depression hits like a truck, I start skipping the gym, and diet gets out of control"

"I'm honestly starting to care less and less about the restrictions.  

Here I am, having socially distanced for months on end despite politics in this country having shit all over me as a young person and student with a complete lack of established concepts of home schooling, even until now, and even having imposed regulations that were mainly aimed at restricting young people such as mandatory curfews at night.    

And on top of that I have waited all the way until yesterday to get fully vaccinated despite supposedly being prioritized due to my medical history but of course my country's equivalent of the CDC removed the vaccine prioritization months before there was any hint of adequate vaccine supply to vaccinate the majority of people that fall in that bracket.  

And now because of conspiracy believing idiots that refuse to get vaccinated I'm supposed to go back into lockdown and have my life be massively restricted again?  
It's a massively shitty situation for those people that can't be vaccinated but fuck me, if you wanna get sick and choke on your own lungs disintegrating then you should have the bloody right to do so and stop interfering with those of us that don't base their world view on made up conspiracy lunacies."

"Holy shit man you're in for a world of trouble.

For starters, 10 weeks isn't quite long enough for a test-only cycle. At the absolute VERY least you need 12 weeks, but beginners should go up to 16-20 weeks in order to learn how to properly dial their hormone levels in.

Secondly, steroids literally don't fucking work if your diet and programming isn't 100% spot on. You're literally going to waste money, waste time, and suppress your natural testosterone production all because you don't know how to eat properly when on blast.

Third, that TS-400 blend is fucking retarded. Seriously, blends like this (or sustanon) are made to be marketable and/or to attract ignorant people who think ""wow this has all kinds of testosterone in it, it must be better!"" which is so far from the truth that it's not even funny.

For the steroid bros who are curious about the blend: 

- Test deco 200mg
- Test isocaporate 30 mg
- Test Phenylproprionte 40mg
- Test Propionate 30mg
- Test Cyp 50 mg
- Test Enanthate 50mg

This is literally the most retarded test blend I've ever seen, it's worse than Sustanon. Why would they combine Cyp and E esters when they're the same god damn thing? Why would they take a SUPER long acting ester and combine it with a super short-acting ester?

OP go to steroidplotter.com and look how long it takes each of these esters to saturate. Your hormones are going to fluctuate so much and because of the prop and phenylprop esters you'll still need to inject every single day for stable levels. 

I hope other new guys are reading this because this is what happens when you don't do your research, blindly order something online without knowing a god damn thing about it, and then try to think you can use steroids as a shortcut despite the fact that you don't even know what your macros should look like.

You're probably going to ignore this advice and use it anyways, you might even reply with something defensive like new guys always do, but you're literally going to get terrible acne, you might get gyno, you're going to get edema and retain water and look all bloated and fat, and your e2 fluctuating is going to make you moody as fuck. You're going to go through all of that for literally no benefit at all. 

Did you even decide if you wanted to PCT after your tiny little 10 weeks are up? Did you know that some of those esters are so long that you can't just stop taking it and start PCT'ing right away? Do you even know what PCT is?

Go to /r/steroids and read the wiki, go to the beginner's section where they talk about what your first cycle should be like."

I have another friend that's overweight, balding, life not really going places. Dude has women over at his place all the goddamn time; he's definitely slept around. Some women are average, some I can't believe agreed to fuck em. He's a generally ok dude, funny as fuck. It's all about personality bro."

It's people like OP that give people unrealistic expectations about what they can achieve. Then he just says ""you're not trying hard enough"", ""I'm 100% natty"" you gotta do xyz. It's dishonest is what it is. Literally no one cares if he juices but people don't like it when you lie about something totally obvious. Definitely has an ego."

"Solid structure and shape, good balance and symmetry..really just good all around. Only thing I‚Äôd say is your frame just needs more density and size, but it‚Äôs got great potential. Just a few things posing wise, your legs are fairly far apart when hitting your BDB, and doing that makes your legs look like they lack depth from the rear when you actually have pretty good hamstrings/adductors(that are decently dug out as well). Bring your feet closer together and turn your right foot out more to really squeeze that glute and hamstring and make them pop more. There‚Äôs a few other things I could nitpick but the way you pose your lower from the rear is the biggest thing you can improve and instantly make your legs look a lot bigger and better from the rear."
"Yeah compounds are impossible.  I switched to bodypart training and rehab for 2 years. I'm old, fat, slow, and on tramadol and celebrex. But I'm not a cripple or on opiates. So proceed as if you mean to be in the game for the long haul."

Thanks! How many calories for maintenance?
blood sugar is your immediate energy. fats slow the release of insulin/blood sugar. around your workout you're burning through most of the sugar in your blood so you want to keep fats minimal in order for it to be replenished quickly. eating most of your fats at night when youre less active will give you a more stable release of energy allowing you to sleep through the night without blood sugar fluctuations waking you up
Sounds good to me!
Not to mention one of the best posers of all time and and an all around awesome representative of the sport.

Life is different for me now.  Family members have passed away, I moved back home, and I haven't been on TRT in about a year.

Sprinting will not hinder your muscle gains. If anything the extra cardio would help body composition a little. Basically you're doing HITT and lots of competitors do that.

"All ya need is some dumbbells and you can pretty much do the majority of the fundamentals. Pick up some plates along the way when you see deals since you will outgrow 80kg fairly quick, provided your diet is on point.

To be honest I find that, when you just have one pair of dumbbells, bodyweight programs are better long term. There's a lot more documentation on how to do progression with bodyweight than with a fixed dumbbell weight."

You guys would rush to call him a fake natty after like a couple months of lifting, let alone a couple years. Just face the fact there are genetic outliers and you're not one of them.

Beautiful results
"Lol I know right. No one was around us and there was 2 people in the gym besides me and my girl take the pics lol. Anyways, I started this cut roughly 12 weeks ago at just shy of 250. Dont really have a goal comp weigh, just wanna look the best I can don‚Äôt care too much about weight. Probably aiming for around 212 ish"
I agree with your statement quads can definitely be built without squats. For me squats really only get my glutes sore.
anyone else notice pressing strength is the hardest to improve when in a bulk/strength phase? leg and pull strength been increasing at a nice rate but my numbers on shoulder and chest presses don't want to budge
I could be convinced... will accept AMC stock.

"Who else is gonna sexually harass you bastards? Or keep bodybuilding sexy?? That's right, me Brad."
Appreciate it! Yea I‚Äôm doing slow refeed.  I was 7 lbs under weight cap and I think competition only gets more fierce as season goes on.  It seems like everyone who didn‚Äôt get a card or gets close to getting a card rolls into next national show.  Rather give body and mind a break and see what next year brings.
For sure. Smith machine squats are great. Also started doing shrugs on the smith machine with great results so far
At that point I just assume people would cut when you're like 2 machines away and laugh
"easy fix, what some competitors can do is offer to get  measured again if you think you have grown and that would be your official height

lots of classic guys complain that they suffer a lot of anxiety preparing for a show as they dont know what their weight cap is. They often say the measuring is so inconsistent with shows one week apart"

"good morning,

since running doggcrapp training i have really taken a liking to a ""beat the logbook"" mentality.  obviously there comes a time in advanced bodybuilding where you can't just continue to add plates to the bar and get infinitely stronger, but for 99% of us, this is the best way to add muscle.  heavy, progressive weights for reps, high protein, lots of food.  there's a few ways to do this, but doggcrapp is a solid foundation to learn intensity.  there is a strict way to follow this program and the info is available on the intensemuscle forums although not quite consolidated.  it will take a lot of studying, but will give you hypertrophy and strength.  i suggest you continue your current program and take a nuanced approach to learning about this method of training.

there is also jordan peter's subscription site, trainedbyjp, which you can try for free.  even as i become a better bodybuilder, it remains a staple in my education.  he has an education section which has hundreds of videos on training, food, drugs, you name it. different splits depending on where you are as a bodybuilder, but with the same approach. heavy progressive weights and food."
Yes!! Honestly if she hadn‚Äôt told me she was going t do it and I found out all of the sudden then yes she would be a goner but she discussed it with me and after she saw my reaction she  opted to workout in a different gym (at first she still defended her decision to workout with the guy doe).
Yes I figured. How tall are you? I would also be curious to see a side chest because I can‚Äôt tell if it is the pose that is making it look smaller than it is. Also your arms are fucking sick.
Oh God the pregnant look. The before bed/waking up contrast still makes me second guess everything I'm doing
"You‚Äôre in pretty good shape for 8 weeks out. Your vacuum pose should only get better as you get closer to the show. But without seeing your other classic poses, obviously I really can‚Äôt say if this is your best one. But it‚Äôs definitely a very solid pose for you. Keep practicing it and make sure you can hold it for an extended period of time."
Jesus save some women for the rest of us
"No way you just said that, fuck man I've always heard that I had bad genetics and shit, fuck man you made my fucking week for saying that, I still got time to grow tho I've been training for like 2 years and 2 months, maybe it's bad to hop on gear early like that but I really wanna take it to the next level."
"Damn you‚Äôre on a 48/96? Bro I fuckin haaaate 48s.  we have 24/72s. I haven‚Äôt done contest prep but i know that cutting sucks enough as it is. I feel absolutely gassed after doing anything fire-related on a cut.

If you haven't already done so, now is a good time to look into [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). It's perfectly normal for people in new positions to feel like they don't know what they're doing, or that they don't belong at their new job. Sometimes it gets bad and you're like ""fuck they're going to find out I don't know what I'm doing and take the new job away from me"" and even that's normal. This is even more so true if you're a male in your early-to-mid 20's.

"So... sounds like you're actually wanting to bulk but on EC for the energy?  In that case don't.  Yeah you can get a big boost from it, but IME it tapers out after 2-3 weeks and you NEED it.

  On top of that, taking it anytime after mid afternoon is gonna fuck with your sleep, making the whole thing counterproductive.  Let's say it gives you a 10% (generous) boost in the gym, but cuts an hour of actual, restful sleep out of your night.  The gym boost isn't worth losing that.  Your sleep and recovery is more important.

  As far as dehydrationg, I don't even sweat alot but will easily get dehydrated if all I'm drinking is straight water.  I discovered several years ago to add some lite salt to my workout drink otherwise I'd flush everything out just drinking water and would get dry lips and be prone to cramping."

Six months is a pretty long time to cut, it might be time to step back to maintenance for a bit. However I would base it off how you feel. Is your metabolism still going strong? Are you losing much strength? How much farther until you feel like you‚Äôre at a good point to add mass again? What is your long term goal, and how does your current physique relate to that goal? Maybe most importantly, take a look at your mental health. Are you just fucking tired of cutting to the point of it really affecting you inside and outside the gym?"

Fitness advice in a bodybuilding sub by an average looking dude. Id give it 3 hours before this post is removed.
I had no idea lmao
"Ok, if I‚Äôm out that way I‚Äôll put it on the list. But only to lift with you, not cause of the gym"
"Holy shit, that's way better than I would've guessed.  Amazing job.  Do you have a coach that helps with this type of stuff or you just know how your body handles prep?"
"But heart disease kills people and cancer so why is something else killing them so bad? I need to workout bro 
/S."
"Well ya see. I wake up I get in the car I drive to the gym and then I put the plate on the barbell

Then I lift the weight up and I put it back down. I do this until I finish the predetermined amount that I planned on.

Then I put everything away and leave"
You cared enough to comment thats good enough for me bb üòò
"Sure they are, but the fucking circle jerkers here have to make it the prime focus of everything. On stage those veins will matter very very little, if at all. And also once hes tanned up they're far less noticeable and i think most actual bodybuilding fans dont care much about them either way."
"Thanks dude, I'll go searching!"
like your shape and those rear delts are legit
"Just gotta say no Whey for a bit. Found this as a replace, pup tent mornings were a surprise. Took away the snack hunger too.[https://www.seedoilcompany.com/product-page/pumpkin-seed-protein-powder](https://www.seedoilcompany.com/product-page/pumpkin-seed-protein-powder)"
"Like the below guy said I've been telling my guy freinds this for a while. 

Girls don't like me I'm lonely. Ok cool so like what you have going on for you? Are you shooting twords a cool job? What about hobbies skills other stuff?

How do you expect a cool high quality girl to want to date you if you can't even do basic life shit?"
"Looking insane dude, you are absolutely Dorito‚Äôd"
"No dude I researched this stuff about 6months ago I‚Äôm not gonna go back through hours of research for a nobody lol

They show an increase of testosterone to normal levels, it did not include diet and exercise sure but we know Robby has been watching his diet and never stopped training so it‚Äôs a given on his part. 

And his test range probably isn‚Äôt crazy we have said normal range the whole time. He is carrying a normal amount of muscle for someone who trains regular. It‚Äôs just crazy because he is old. But if his test levels are in the normal range he should be able to hold a normal amount of muscle which he does. We never said it was gonna make you a beast but put you in normal range. Do more research yourself, actually read the other two articles. I‚Äôm not gonna go back through hours of research so you can just say ‚Ä¶ ok or not respond. Stop kidding yourself you aren‚Äôt that important lol go read for yourself. 

You have also got to factor it this isn‚Äôt the only herb he is taking, these with a balanced diet, training(he never stopped) and good genetics for bodybuilding and I believe you can look like this. He said he never used testosterone, and test wants used in the 70s when he competed and said he never would. Do some research on all the herbs he takes and what they do.

Also go look up Stanford professor Andrew Hubbard who says tongkat Ali does indeed work and boost testosterone. Go read what I sent you, listen to Hubbard, and come back. So yes spoon fed I gave you three articles and you read one and formed and opinion."
"I hope all goes well for you competition wise, and your health. üëçüèæ"
Why do you want compression pants? Just wear joggers.
Each day. Thanks.
"Lmao! 

Funny answer.

But yeah he‚Äôs got a lot more beer belly than me."
Dude. You are the fucking man‚Äî this is awesome!
"Thank you so much. It's just a mark from squatting low bar for years. If you look closely, it's on my left delt too, just a bit more pronounced on the right, probably more sensitive skin üôÇ Funny thing about that, I had a gap year due to gym closures and the marks had started to fade. I was really glad to get them back haha I like to wear them like battle scars"
"Starting Gamma Bomb today. Ran nSuns a couple times &amp; majority of the time I run PPL.

"I think volume is the word im looking for, my bad"
There‚Äôs a reason I stopped posting actual prep logs here. Some dude felt the need to tell me he wouldn‚Äôt want to fuck me on my last pics. Because we all know that‚Äôs entirely why I do bodybuilding and get to single digit body fat. Guess I‚Äôll go cry because someone half my age and half my size doesn‚Äôt want to give me their pathetic gummy worm for 30 seconds of pathetic sex.
The worse in my opinion is those super skinny stickino's doing lat pulldowns taking 20 min to do a set on 50lbs!
Yes but I'd like to have good enough mechanics to squat free weight without injury
"Tested going to failure on squats today for the first time in forever.

Got up to 230 lb. x 5 before missing the 6th rep. PR. Yay."
"&gt; Sounds more like libido if you ask me

"Thanks, no intention on quittingüòÅ"
I wanna look like goku
You win!!
"Yeah i gotchu bro. I don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôve noticed that like dropping subtle hints really helps? Like if you can tell a girl may be interested in you and you wanna make the most of it you can try asking her about her interests and shit. Girls take literally anything as hints so you can literally be like ‚Äúoh your eyes are really cool I like them‚Äù and that‚Äôll be enough to keep them thinking. Ease into it. Yes, sometimes it‚Äôs good to be straight up and be like ‚Äúyoure really attractive‚Äù but I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs only if you know the girl is 100% into you. If any of that makes sense"
Arnold was the best of his time. He didn't get any Hollywood fame until after Pumping Iron and winning his Olympias.

"I mean, the genetics are great for competition for sure, but I hate the whole thing about ""bad genetics"". Bad genetics for competition can be amazing for other situations."
"Yeah, his core looks like trash for being on stage, and especially compared to everything else."
"Lately I've been feeling weird after workout. Usually it's all good, feeling pumped, endorphins and all that good shit. But lately it's that plus a sick feeling, like a light flu. It goes away in the evening. Tried stopping for a couple of days. Same feeling when starting again. Tried lighter training and it went away but also the good part is kinda missing. Any idea what's wrong?
I only use BCAA and Whey isolate as supplements and that didn't change. Diet is the same, lots of meat, eggs, cheeses, Musli, veggies, fruits, rice."
"&gt; 6 days of intense physical training be recompensed with just a single day of rest

? you're getting at least 2 days between muscle groups unless your programming is retarded"
"5/3/1 is a strength program, you‚Äôre not going to be able to run it without at least a barbell and a rack. Just get a gym membership, you‚Äôre not going to be able to do much with such limited equipment. You could throw together a very basic home gym relatively cheaply too."
What are good options for sauce?
This has to be a joke right? Kid I bulk on 5K if 1500 is a lot you must look like a broomstick
"That‚Äôs the plan, I have a hard cutoff at 220 and monitor regularly because you‚Äôre completely right. An unhinged dirty bulk got me fat once and never again, getting to 215 faster than expected is actually what got me thinking about either a recomp or a slow down."
"Me af. 

Works 11 hours straight with minimal food to go straight to working out and feeling weak. Also me : ‚Äúwhy do I feel weak today ? :/‚Äú"
There's a bb Google drive that has it for free
Didn‚Äôt do shit for me either. I didn‚Äôt really expect it to do much though. I eat a diet full of nutrient dense foods and recovery is on point which will bring the most noticeable change.
Holy fuck dawg. That's some solid aesthetics
This is like a shitty twista
"Keep cutting, then lean bulk when you're shredded. I've made the mistake of bulking when I wasn't lean enough ... and it was not pretty"
"&gt;  I just feel like they are usually made really long and come down too far below my waist,

my manlet detector is off the charts!"
Could've done it natty but good progress nonetheless
"Yeah thats why I dont use sarms, but thats the rationale I keep hearing. It is true that most sarms rape your liver and kidneys less than harsher anabolics and thats where people get the safe argument. The carsinogenic one is cardarine amd its actually not a sarm at all even if its marketed as one. The carsinogenic effect is being depated constantly as well. The studies it comes from are done on mice giving them equivalent of 40mg on humans for 75% of their lifespan. This obviously doesn‚Äôt model the way the drug is used in humans (more like 20mg for 6 weeks). The fact still stands that at least in some protocol cardarine produced tumors on rodents."
Yeah wow was this show particularly stacked?
That‚Äôs an excellent burn my man.
"Thanks, I really appreciate your willingness to always help everyone in here."
"Wish I had diarrhea. So emptying, so satisfying."
"What bothers me most is when people judge my hobbies. Of course lifting is one of mine but I have a huge passion in technology, I work in tech. Most people equate that to me being a nerd lol."
"Yes, there is a limit of carb utilization around training and throughout the day, which is where supplementation and insulin use comes in. You can't say food is the only limiting factor when insulin is involved. More insulin -&gt; more carbs can be utilized and it becomes a balancing act of using enough drugs and eating enough food to keep yourself growing without literally dying from blood sugar shock. And how is it a bad comparison? The original post was asking why bodybuilders don't eat more liquid calories and the answer is because the calories aren't the only factor."
"I usually incorporate some kind of ""drop set"" methodology whenever I work out. Like, I'll get to the end of my set, lower the weight, and then lift until I fail a second time. Does that actually help gain muscle? I still do 3-4 sets."
"That's amazing, you look totally different from before! Keep it up and best of luck to you on your show"
those wings tho... best pair of lats next to dorian
Post pics then nerd.

"Yes but it's negligible; it's easier to elevate your heart rate when you're hot and sweating. However, when you're cold the body will burn more cals trying to raise body temp so in the end it really doesn't have any impact."

People literally hate Breon for no reason other than the fact that they're Cbum dick riders.
Not falling for this trap contact my agent for a statement.
"If you've solely been doing strength training, then PHAT or PHUL would be a great segue into hypertrophy training. You might need to modify some of the accessory work a bit to get it down to just 4 hours a week though."
Best of luck man! Hope you do really well. Btw show the legs! Love how your pic quality still sucks üòÇ reminds me of you posting on MD and always getting criticized for your potato cam quality.

Arnold split. And true to form he replaced leg day with more bench.
"Yes, I would consider a rdl for hamstring hypertrophy a different exercise altogether. It‚Äôs largely in the set up. To focus on hamstrings, you almost want your legs to be perpendicularto the ground at all times, with the bar a couple inches in front of your shins, and pulling with the bar a few inches in front of your body the whole RoM, stopping just above your knees (where tensions shifts from hams to glutes). 


For a strength based rdl, traditional deadlift set up with the bar touching your shins, your butt out behind your feet, and pull in line with your center of gravity, while also pushing through with your glutes at the top."
Eating a bunch of shit before I start a cut/diet tomorrow. Spent the weekend labouring and consequently fucked up my cut the first time.
I gave it the benefit of the doubt &amp; clicked it. It's written as poorly as a three year old's essay about nonsensical secrets they know.
"Wrong. You are just a loser injector who needs to feel better about himself juicing.

I thought creatine was the most studied and safe supplement?  What dosage is abuse?
"Uh

That was sarcasm m8. I genuinely hope you don't quit. Lifting is life-changing if you do it properly."
"?? Breon‚Äôs physique looks like it‚Äôs straight out of the 80s, very classic and his posing is good."
"Just a warning to everyone who doesn't read that sub regularly, tread lightly when you head to the comments section over there, it's like walking across a minefield."
"Cutting off all verbal communication changes the way I perceive others and others perceive me since it's a barrier to communication.  It's pretty much impossible to come off as friendly and sincere to a stranger when you can only communicate with your eyes and your voice.

That then leads to depression due to not being able to socialize.

Plus it's compounded by the fact that a mask mandate basically means all mass gatherings are gonna get cancelled, and indoor social venues will have way less people at them.  Idk if you ever went to bars in April and early-May, but the environment is completely different between then and now.

So yeah again, it's not in my head.  It's a very real phenomenon.  Masks aren't just something that makes socializing slightly more difficult.  They pretty much make it impossible to socialize with strangers."
"I always feel bad bugging them, I figured it would eventually come up organically kind of like just now :)"
"My arm has been feeling this pain while I benched, i tried playing though it and it‚Äôs getting worse so now I hade to rest is.
I hate injuries man, fuck it‚Äôs over"
I appreciate the use of a scale we can understand.

"[It's so much cheaper. You make a shake with egg whites and oatmeal. You realize how cheap that is? Oatmeal is so cheap.

Oh nah man ik all about the ratio but a tiny little part of me is still holding out hopes ill get a compliment from a chick even tho ik it won't happenüòî. Its ok tho all I need is the bros
"I definitely had way less gains when I was on 50-70gs of protein each day.

But I‚Äôve had upwards of 185gs of protein to just 100. I think the sweet spot for me is 120-130 a day. Any more then that I honestly can‚Äôt tell a difference. I could probably be fine with just 100-110."
"Angle is definitely a little funky here but fucking christ, Keone is a monster"
Do you mind giving it to me?
I‚Äôd be shocked if he made it that long honestly. Not hating. Dude works his ass off for sure. I think those calves/shins are signs of an underlying health condition. Hopefully he is being monitored by medical professionals.
i am watching him on RBP now and yeah i think he is impressive ... but a tad boring lol so thats why i forgot his name
"You can do it, it's pretty much what works best for you, and this new split that you're asking about it pretty much just has 1 rest day, so instead of letting the muscles rest for around 72 hours, they'll now get more like 48 hours, I reckon change it up and see how it works, because for the past few years I pretty much changed my split every few weeks til I found what worked best for me, so supposedly change it up and see how it works bro."
WTF is that garbage and why does it cost so much lol
"""stupid idiot who doesn't get bloodwork"" works good too!"
Great looking young man
"It is not healthy to be contest ready lean, regardless of diet, probably even worse if vegan."
"Boof it, you‚Äôll be fine"
I was running creeping death II during my cut last month. I felt like dog shit. Way too much volume for me. Took a break from it now. Will probably run it again after my strength block.
"If you really want to be the next Arnold, start now. Fuck it."
Love chicken liver! Unbelievably cheap too
Yeah it‚Äôs kind of weird to me
"I'd say worry about one thing at a time. Of you are still losing fat, keep at it, and keep lifting hard.  Whether you hit your bench goal before you finish your cut isn't really worth worrying about. Just keep working.

Once you finish your cut, I'd probably bulk. The easiest (and, in my opinion, best) way to get stronger is to put on more muscle.  Trying to keep yourself light doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me unless you have a good reason."
What the hell am I reading/looking at
"Lose weight, work abs"
"Oh yeah not in general, just in terms of legal shit that can give you intense dreams it's neat in my experience."
It's good stuff. Salvia extract uwu
"Oh no, 3 reps? Will your gains ever recover?!

"Shit I always forget that, I compete in BB obviously üòÇ it‚Äôs unfortunately a tough pill to swallow not bringing home the win, just keep it up, every opportunity is an opportunity to learn. Time to eat!"
Favorite cardio is heavy bag work. Gets my heart rate up and sweat like crazy.
"Yeah I basically mean a separate workout dedicated to abs with a mix of resistance and body weight stuff. I‚Äôd split my stuff up into 6 total sets for obliques, 6 total sets for crunch-type exercises, and 6 total sets for leg raise variations."
You can't change the doctor lol
Influencer gang is safer
"Definitely not. You're not going to be open Mr Olympia as a natural but you can still build an amazing physique with a bit of patience and willingness to learn.

Keep in mind that the average person's idea of ""being jacked"" is very different from the Internet's. To most people, you will look like you lift and they will notice."

"So fun morning.

Whoever at my work closed last night somehow some way managed to shove a decent sized   trash carrier in a door that only half opens and just left it there all night

Now logically speaking it would take more effort to lodge this thing in there then it would to you know

Just leave it be. I have no idea why this person attempted to defy physics and logic in such a way nor do I understand how. 

Also not only was that done they didn't actually empty any of them. So upon coming into work I was greeted with a ridiculous amount of flies and bugs because we live in Florida. One of the bags in  a different carrier was so filled I couldn't lift it without it ripping and making a bigger mess. So I had to grab gloves and empty it by hand along with having to take out the rest of it.

10 out of 10 morning"
"Sorry, but one week is not enough time to cause noticeable changes to one‚Äôs voice or muscle size, etc. Just simply having higher testosterone won‚Äôt build noticeable muscle without weight training anyway. Also, sexuality is not determine by one‚Äôs hormone levels. Many gay men have high testosterone levels and it simply makes them more horny for other men. Just as women who use steroids don‚Äôt turn into lesbians."
"Impressive, good luck."
One of the best. Can‚Äôt wait for him to blow peoples‚Äô minds when he returns to the stage.
"So bad... like you won‚Äôt build any muscles at all. You might even grow negative muscles that eat your positive muscles.

"I like your approach, the only thing i think is hard is.... you mention look at one thing that you like every time you see something you don't like. In bodybuilding everything is looked at as a full package and the package ""looks"" ruined in the eyes of the beholder when something is lacking. I understand that this is sometimes irrational but we cant help it all the time. Pictures are the key though, I find that they progress even when the weights and the weight does not."

"You may get more help in r/steroids. You probably tanked your estrogen with the AI (btw aromasin or arimidex are usually more recommended), don't know about your blood values without the reference ranges, but I think the test is a little below the lowest ""healthy"" reference range. It's likely that the test was bad but you may also be a low responder.

Tbh at this point the best option would be to do a PCT and maybe do a cycle later on, if you wanted to continue it you would need to first get a new source, then up the dose again, wait for the test to saturate... You would be too many weeks on exogenous test IMO."

My two cents but I would just train hard in the gym regardless if you're cutting/maintaining/bulking. Try to progressive overload every session. Repeat. But whatever works for you!"

"Yeah I saw it. So I'm not using any of the actual RP templates, I just use RP as a descriptor for that style of training (descending RIR and ascending volume).

It's very simple. Say I start a meso with 8 sets of quads (which is my MEV, minimum effective volume) at 3-4 RIR in week 1. I add 1-2 sets and decrease RIR by 1 each week until I reach 12-14 sets, which is my MRV (maximum recoverable volume) for that muscle group at 0 RIR. Then I deload. The RP templates go to 6 weeks I think but 5 is the sweet spot for me. 

Mike Israetel has a ton of videos explaining most of this."

I just stopped trying to help because some of them have a ‚Äúcoach‚Äù helping them and most of the time advice on fitness is not taken as advice but as critique.

A friend was taking a mass gainer and quarter repping squats, tried to give advice but he answered with, ‚Äúcoach says it‚Äôs ok so I‚Äôm gonna keep on doing it‚Äù 

Another friend it‚Äôs not tracking her progress on losing weight because  ‚Äúher coach said it‚Äôs better so she won‚Äôt get obsessed with her weight‚Äù. I mean I get that but how tf are you gonna know if you‚Äôre losing too much weight or not losing enough?? I mean her body is gonna plateau sooner or later and she won‚Äôt know it because she won‚Äôt weight and measure herself ‚Äúuntil the challenge is over‚Äù

"After your newbie gains, you hit that plateau. If you can break that first plateau (which usually only requires consistent diet and training) you should hop on. I take that back. No one should probably hop on, like ever, but since you said you already made up your mind... yeah, go for it."

"Self esteem problems while bulking as a teenager

I am currently cutting, but when I was bulking, accepting my own image and how others saw me was difficult...

I am only 15 yo/ and going from being loved by all the girls and admired by all my friends for my abs and muscular definition to an ugly and fat boy was not an easy job.

I was skinny as fuck but all the chicks liked it... I wanted to gain muscle so i started a bulk and then i got fat af. All my clothes got tight and i slowly realized that i had became ugly and chubby. I gained like 20kg in like 2-4 months aprox...

In the gym I felt great, I had more and more strength but all my friends joked with my appearance and no girl wanted to kiss me... In fact I did not pick up a single girl in 2020. 

Because of all that shit, my self-esteem got lower and lower ... so I decided it was time to change and I started cutting...

Now (almost like 4 months in calorie deficit) i feel good. Girls are starting to get interested in me and i kind like what i see in the mirror. My clothes fit again and I have abs... However i still dont like taking my shirt off that much...

What I'm going to is that in a few months I will have to start a new bulking ... But I'm afraid ... I don't want to go through the same bs again.

What do you guys advise me? Thanks."
thanks. Today was also my first time squatting with sleeves and this is also the first time ive ever buckled like that. Not sure if that would have any impact but i will def keep what you mentioned in mind.

Honestly, I‚Äôm glad I get to graduate Med school looking my best, but the last two years have been real tough working on the covid front lines, mental health could be better, physical health is looking good though.

"I've only done ""extreme"" weight loss once when I was 17 and went from an obese 240lbs to 155. Other than that I usually gain 10-15 lbs during bulks before I think I'm getting too fat and start cutting. My cuts are standard at 1 lb a week. I usually start at 2200 during a cut and lowest I'll go is 1800. I usually don't go that low though since I'd rather just stay 2000 and add cardio instead. 

In any case it's not like those levels were taken mid cut, they were taken mid bulk."

I just created an indisputable equation for what constitutes ""big biceps"" based on absolutely nothing.  At 6 feet tall, 17"" biceps look good.  For every three inches below, subtract one inch.  For every three inches above, add one inch.

"Well, Flex really only looked good at a lighter weight. He won his pro card around 215 in weight. And was about the 230ish for the 93 Ironman, and 216ish for the 93 Arnold about a week later. And about 218 for the 93 O. At the 1997 Arnold, for which he training with the aforementioned Shawn Ray, he was about 224, and was soft in the glutes and hams. He was about 235ish at the 98 Arnold, maybe a tad more. Flex‚Äôs body type is about the same as Brian Buchanan, Melvin Anthony, Cedric mcMillian, and Lionel Beyeke. They look better at a relative lighter body weight. Their structure/genetics are not like someone like Ronnie Coleman or Chris Cormier. 

Think about it, Flex looked his best at 215-220ish, at a height of 5‚Äô10! And even Dex told Melvin to stop gaining weight, or he‚Äôd lose his aesthetics. But Melvin didn‚Äôt listen. He didn‚Äôt want to weigh less than he did when got his Pro card.

Shawn Ray competed forever at 205, and was barely over 201 pounds back in the early 90s. His conditioning got blurry when competed at 210-215. He was basically a lighter 212 guy. Roelly, Dex, Lee Preist, Brandon Curry, all weigh significantly more than Shawn Ray did, at roughly the same height."

"Wow lol your question and then showing a screenshot talking about coolsculpt or other non-invasive lipo... ""thinks surgery is is ok"" ... get the fuck outta here.

What's next, she gets Botox in her armpits to stop sweating and you call that implants?

But to be actually on topic - plastic surgery and bodybuilding - I think if you can get away with it then why not? BB'ers been using SEO for decades upon decades, and if an implant can do the same without being horribly obvious, why not? If someone has jagged or otherwise unattractive teeth, would veneers to make a big pearly smile be unfair? Why? Hair transplants after you sacrifice your hairline to the Tren Gods? Colored contacts? Where do you draw the line, and why would it be a bad thing?

Many women lose their tiddies leaning out for a show, implants okay? Why not, given they have a great surgeon and they look good and fit the frame?"

I‚Äôm doing a linear periodization program with lots of accessories right now, but it eventually tapers into pretty heavy weights for 1-3 reps at the end of 12 weeks, and since it‚Äôs by Ben Pollack i‚Äôm p much just taking his word that focusing on increasing strength in this way is optimal compared to just adding weight when possible. Question is, is it actually? Would adding weight/reps whenever possible inside a rep range i stick to give just as much strength/size gains? 

Been stuck at 250 bench for a while and essentially neglected squat and deadlift after having no upper body upon finishing strong lifts 5x5, and constantly stuck between this idea of training for strength vs training for aesthetics cause i just wanna be a greek god ffs

Appreciate the responses :)"
Built bars not bad. Macros are pretty legit.
Nice job on the win! I think bringing up your arms and delts would take your physique to another level.
You posted a single relaxed photo of your front upper body ... not exactly enough gauge if you are aesthetic or not.
"Doesn‚Äôt look like ass work to me, looks like back work."
how to get arms like you?
"Your waist is definitely not Chris Bumstead‚Äôs but your V really makes it look smaller. Just watch the trunks so they make you slimmer, maybe place them lower and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be taking the gold home."
"im sure this is a common feeling among early 20something year olds but could i get some reassurance? i feel like im having a quarter life crisis

just graduated college with a degree in a field i have no interest in, 20k in debt and making $20 an hour in a high cost of living area still living with my parents. I'm feeling really pressured to move out but I feel like this isnt the best choice financially. Just got denied for a job after a final interview and feeling demotivated to go through the whole sending out my resume/doing 3 rounds of interviews thing again. just feeling really overwhelemed and like im nowhere near as ""successful"" as i should be. is it gonna be ok? lol"

If it works it isn‚Äôt stupid. You can theoretically get a good workout in lifting rocks.
"Yes I use the tape measure because the scale is just 1 tool and people get overly reliant on that.  I'm down to a 30"" waist, when I've gotten down to to 31"" inches right before shows."

Yep. The whole reason I love lifting is so I can test my limits.

Yeah that's the issue. Reheating it is garbage. I use thighs instead of breasts for chicken and 4 days later it's just as delicious as freshly cooked.

"Honestly you can train with bodyweight and do a lot of endurance work untill you go back to the gym. I dont see a reason to not train even during lockdown.  


I personally started working out again after 7 years and i've made more gains last 9 months with bodyweight and basic exercises with w/e weight i have rather the 6months i powerlifted the last time i went to the gym.  Let's see if manage to get thta bitch ass muscle up before gyms open cause i'm scared of my shoulders still due to old injury."
"Interesting. Try it, tell us how it goes. I‚Äôm interested to hear your results."
bruh his weight cap was like 170-175 in classic which solidly puts him in the 5'5 range. i doubt someone could lie about their height in a show cause it would vastly change their weight cap......

"Amen! Thank you so much, the positive words and support from people on here is incredible. I don‚Äôt mind sharing at all, just remember I come from anorexia and so some of my methods may seem a little extreme or weird.... I had high discipline for my diet starting out when I made the decision to ‚Äúlean bulk‚Äù and get healthy after a several year bout of anorexia, I would eat nothing and work 5 days, only drinking water, and binge eating/drinking every weekend. Longest I fasted was 17 days on water and was 128lb. Extremely unhealthy. I always have been big on cardio and walking, nowadays I average 8 miles a day year round with some days hitting 15-20, huge advocate of LISS cardio, I sprint occasionally but not more than 5-10% of my days mileage because it hurts my back and I see too many old fat people running which means it‚Äôs not working well for them either lol. So I love walking... constantly moving and avoiding long periods of sitting is important to me and so is stretching, when I started lifting I focused heavily on flexibility. I did not want to get big and lean, but not be able to touch my toes or scratch my own back due to muscles in the way. So every day I stretch first thing when I stand up out of bed, before doing anything. Just basic palms on the floor and hamstring stretching intensely for 2-3 minutes. Never have skipped a day. Can hop into the splits on command now lol... so next i started with basic body weight exercises, lots of plank, and push ups mainly. For first 3-6 months, then bought a condo with a gym, and workout in the gym 3-4 days a week for weights, and do body weight exercises 2-3 days a week. Spend about 2 hours in the gym or when doing home exercises, I own a dip bar, pull up bar, and an ab wheel. Today was push up day, so I did 30 mins in the gym this morning just doing some bicep curls, shoulder presses, and 3 point db rows. Then did 300 push ups in the evening in sets of 25-35 with slow negative movement. Tomorrow is ab day and back day. So I‚Äôll do 3 sets of 20 ab roll outs, and then hit gym and do lat raises, a variety of rows, and hot obliques. My diet has been consistent over the past 2 years as extremely high protein, very low fat, high carb. I aim for 300 or more grams of protein every day, less than 50g of fat per day, and I‚Äôm pretty lenient on carb intake, aim for 180-200g a day but sometimes carbs go higher. If I eat too much on a heavy lifting day and I decide to take a rest day, then I‚Äôll intermittent fast for 2-3 days to balance out the negatives in any overages in my weekly macros. So basically, stretching every day, walking 8 miles every day, playing Pickleball, and doing some form of exercise every day where I‚Äôm maxing out a different group of muscles has been my goal. Biggest challenge for me has been not to have panic attacks when I look in the mirror and see myself as fat. I know I‚Äôm not but am overly critical of myself and care about aesthetics more than strength, my worst nightmare is waking up and looking like a heavy power lifter or guy who dirty bulked too long and just looks fat. That would be the day I lose it. Hope this helps, also hope you don‚Äôt ever have to struggle with an eating disorder or body dysmorphia, God Bless!"

"Pretty surprised by the progress I've made by doing random stuff.

I have adjustable dumbbells and an adjustable bench in my room. Maybe two months ago I started lifting again. And by that I mean mainly doing dumbbell curls, shoulder press, and incline dumbbell press. Talking 5-10 sets of each throughout the day or over the course of several hours. Sometimes I would be watching a show and do a set at the start of each episode. And I'd do this maybe twice a week

My weight has fluctuated a lot during this time too. From 180 to 168 to 175 to now 185. BTW I absolutely have not been eating properly. My Macros are wack. One day ill eat 100-150g of protein. Maybe not eat the next day. Maybe get 50g protein. regularly eating at 500-750 deficit. Then binging on high calories and protein for 2-3 days. 

Going for 30-60 minute jogs 2-3 times a week.

I honestly cant believe actually progress was made. I love my noob gainz."

"It's no secret that the majority of bodybuilders have eating disorders. Id argue that most start bodybuilding because of preexisting disorders that they may or may not even be aware of. I think the reason it's not really talked about is because it's just part of the ""sport"" and what drives us to these places is usually very individual and personal. It's also usually not a good idea to bring some of those topics to open forums like this because people can get triggered and some very (very) poor advice gets given. Bodybuilding forums should be focused on the good and healthy aspects of the sport. If someone is really struggling and chooses to reach out, imo, it's best to point them in the right direction and let professionals do what they're there for."

When I'm bulking and I have fat on my abs and back, at least I feel like I'm on the up-swing with muscle and strength.

But that point where you've cut a good all amount of fat but aren't shredded? And you are busting your ass to maintain, both muscle and strength. The fuckin worst."

Big moves. It‚Äôs great seeing nationally competitive people here and you‚Äôve put in the fucking time.
"1. This sounds like you're describing your dream man

2. Why is your wrist so long? Your own description makes no sense, &amp; your inability to provide proof of you being in any way fit just tells me you're full of shit."
"Have PR'd on shitty days more than once, those feel awesome. Really good lifts btw!"
You look awesome! Keep it up
Sounds like it's going as it should then!
Not with my genetics no.
"Idk if this is common sense but I can‚Äôt find a clear answer for this.

All the way down on leg press or not?
And I suppose squat too, but I think I‚Äôve come to the conclusion its very popular to go as low as you can on squats."
You could do 1-2 TM blocks and then CD2
‚ÄúUsed to squat like you till I took a barbell to the knee‚Äù
"That‚Äôs a good way to look at it. I know I‚Äôll never be a Phil Heath or Chris Bumstead, but I have really high expectations for myself to a point where it seems unhealthy to most people. As of now I want to see how far I can go in natural competitions."
Stop Posting Shit Read Rules
"I mean assuming your 10 lb loss wasn‚Äôt taken as a low point at the start and a high point at the end (but rather a weekly average), I don‚Äôt think you are in a 1,000 kcal deficit. When you start dieting you have metabolic adaptations that occur. You could be an extreme case especially since you (I am assuming you started at maintenance, else the entire discussion is absurd) slashed 1,000 kcal from your daily energy intake. Your metabolism slows slightly and your body adapts by burning less calories through decreased overall movement everyday. 

To say it simply, assuming everything you said is accurate, you are not in a 1000 calorie deficit. Assume a lb of weight loss is roughly 3,500 kcal and do the calculations yourself for how many days you have been in a deficit and you will find your energy deficit."
It helps when you upload the code you fixed....
I don‚Äôt like Phil or his attitude but Gosh darn that is an absolute perfect physique!
"I was doing a deficit that helped me lose alot of fat around 25 pounds in total but i lost a couple pounds of muscle, despite protein intake being normal.  Is this normal?

Edit: the main issue being that during my deficit i feel like i was losing too much muscle."
"As a natural you can build a physique that 99% of people think looks phenomenal. Spending a lot of time in bodybuilding culture, however, is likely to warp your perceptions and make you see that kind of physique as ""just okay""."
"6'3"" over here champ and I feel ya. Certain exercises put us at a mechanical disadvantage, deadlifts really suck with long legs and I feel my long arms make it harder to hit my pecs effectively with heavy weight. Not to mention having to pack in a shitload more food - I have previously been 94ish kilos bulking at 3900kCal. That's a LOT of poopin'.

Bodybuilding's a lifelong pursuit tho, etc, I mean 18 months to two years is really not that long in the grand scheme of things. Plus - I'm just guessing - neither of us would trade away our height for more gains if that were even an option."
"I get thar this is the wrong subreddit, but wtf is wrong with these comments? I mean, chill the fuck out."

I would say that it makes him more imposing yes. I am honestly not sure what judges will make of it but I don‚Äôt see it as displeasing. Rock that god given tree trunk of a neck.

"We need the link to the original comment where he said that shit, I tried looking yesterday but couldn't find it."
Good luck
In the mind lol
"hmm, I suck at picking out Abs &amp; Thigh stuff, so I really don't know. I think this is one you should just opt to *not* twist on though. if all your poses are twisting the judges could notice, but if some are fully front on and still look great then they can wave it off."
Thank you so much for this. Will definitely incorporate these into my warm ups. Was also thinking about putting 5lb plates at the top of my feet when squatting to counterbalance it. Would that help?

Thanks a lot means a lot! Time to grow!
Yes.  5x5 would force you into a disciplined and consistent regimen with consistent and aggressive progressive overload which will yield much better results both short and long term for someone with your level of training.  Worry about hypertrophy when you reach intermediate status.  Cause its going to take more than 30 minutes 3 times a week.
Wicked vacuum man!
"Great work, but not bodybuilding."
"Lol, I never said 319x3 would hurt, I said straining my pec hurt. I've done 225x21 before on squats. Then I did seven more sets to failure. I wasn't even close to crying. I've done 225x30 on bench press and 315x16 on deadlift. None of it hurt at all.

Acting like going to failure is some sort of extremely painful experience is laughable."

How would fear of confrontation apply here? Do you mean people are too polite to break up before it gets toxic??
"Goddamn it, I know I shouldn‚Äôt pay that much attention to how much I lift but I‚Äôve been struggling with 225 on squat for ages. I used to be able to hit 10 reps with the weight but now I can barley get 3-5.

He literally is taking drugs to suppress his immune system on purpose because he has a kidney transplant. You may not know that so I‚Äôll give you the benefit of the doubt. So vaccines are going to be extremely ineffective for transplant recipients.

Vaccines don‚Äôt have 100% effectiveness. Against the original covid strain it was in the 90%, and for the delta strain it was lower so it does happen.

Listen, anyone talkin about VAERs that you‚Äôre listening to they‚Äôre being disingenuous.

Makes it ‚Äúabundantly clear‚Äù cause of the VAERs data? You understand anyone can report something right? I can say on a VAERs report right now that me and all my friends penis shrunk by 80% after taking the vaccine and they document it. You can say anything on them. There is no governing body that approved any documentation there anyone can post anything and it‚Äôs all excepted. It‚Äôs not from doctors or hospitals. You can just go onto the website and say anything. It‚Äôs incredibly unscientific. It has some value tho‚Ä¶

You can have a good of people who are super anti-vax to bombard the VAERs system with fake data and there is no system that weeds out any of the BS that people just make up. 

And yes there are plenty of people willing to do that to push their agenda."

"They‚Äôre both definitely much closer to a Y framed physique. They have small waists and high, large flaring lats and very wide shoulders. X framed is more like Breon, Ronnie, Flex, Phil, Kai. A Y framed physique is more like Chris, Arnold, Serge, Sergio Sr., Frank Zane. Patrick has more of a Y frame because his waist is small for an Open competitor, but his waist isn‚Äôt small enough and his lats don‚Äôt flare enough to be classic. He looks great, but he wouldn‚Äôt do well in Classic."

"Bros,

My progress has been pretty poor and I've always ran 5-6 day programs with at least 2-3x frequency and always mostly powerbuilding style. I've ran PPL, PHAT, Jacked and Tan, nSns programs and currently one year of Average to Savage by Greg Nuckols. I've trained for 5-7 years.

I gain a lot of fat when I bulk and then I seem to lose almost all the muscle mass I've built despite training hard and copious amounts of protein (3x BW in grams), even though I'm pretty small at 180cm, 71kg body weight currently. OHP 57.5kg, bench 90kg, squat 145kg, DL 180kg. My pressing has always been garbage and a year of doing some sort of pressing 5 days a week hasn't really brought me results.

I was thinking I could perhaps try 531 but maybe that's just another strength focused program where I'll just be doing more sets of 3-5. Maybe I should just try something completely different? What kind of program do you run if you have pure bodybuilding focus?"

"Another lovely day in paradise.  Hit a pretty good leg and core day at le home gym:

I think this summer of this fall I'm gonna run low test and var.  I want to see if I can get down to a lower bf% first.  One thing that bothered me about cycling before was that it became pretty obvious that I'm on gear to anyone that's around me for long enough.  It effects the way my face looks and everything.  So I'm hoping running a more mild cycle  will combat that.  I'm deciding weather I want to continue living with my parents while I'm in school or move out again.  If I live with them it will be a necessity to do stealth mode.  Idk maybe I'll just move in with my boy and run 500 test C and turnibol and get huge lol

Overall I saw a lot of progress, mainly I think because I took 5 years off from lifting and got back into it 6 months ago. I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm stalling for bulk or just getting fat, but lifts are definitely starting to become stagnant even though I am improving form immensely"

"Don't say *even* Arnold. That's like saying ""Even John Holmes had a bigger penis than that."""
I had the same problem. What helped me was I would push back my last meal till about 8pm and make sure it was 600-700 calories so that I was full/satisfied and had no calories left for the day.
"That's fucking disgusting, gross douche"

I'm saying that you're asking ""is 8 sets each of biceps and triceps enough."" To which the short answer is ""depends on you but I'd probably increase volume slightly particularly for triceps"" and the long answer is all that I typed above.

But for the sake of simplicity, the TL;DR is no matter how you do it, I prefer triceps to be trained more frequently than biceps."
Thank you! Planned to come into the show coasting and it's worked wonderfully so far.
Thank you Mr. Meadows!
"Thanks bro!!

Koreans like to keep fit overall. A lot of people go to gyms, and some of the more serious-casuals will even take their SBD lifts serious. 

As for bodybuilding shows, yeah there are a ton. Especially nabba, pca and another called fitness star. But the majority of people that compete compete in like sport/fitness model categories where you don‚Äôt need a ton of muscle, just need to be peeled. So a lot of competitors are natties. I wouldn‚Äôt say bodybuilding is underground, but it‚Äôs definitely not main stream.

It's weird that you think you're owed him telling you about his drug use.

"Standards can change and people are free to criticize these changing standards. Based on the logic you presented, it actually is possible that someday men's physique competitors will be bigger than classic competitors, since standards can change and ""it seems weird to argue the bigger guy shouldn't win"".

"Yeah I'm definitely not on a mission to get hella shredded.  Like 10 lbs tops is what I'd lose.  I know that long term I need to put on mass so I can get a bigger upper body that accommodates my frame, but short-term I sorta just wanna get cut for the sex appeal.

At the end of the day I think I enjoy being strong too much, and that in combination with the fact that I have lots of room to grow means that bulking to 220+ will probably be the move I make."
Those tricks are pretty sick tho ngl.

"You get what you pay for.

I think it‚Äôs bc people don‚Äôt consider basic economics.

They spend $15 for a double cheeseburger meal or movie ticket, both pleasures last about two hours, while cheating out on products that hold equity.

If you spend $200 on 2x45 plates, and then $30 for shipping but you use it five hours a week, every week, for years, it‚Äôs an easy decision.

I dropped a grand on a barbell, plates, and a few dumbbells in the fall and easily have spent 150+ hours with them since September. Even that breaks it down to $6 an hour just in the first four months. Easy purchase decision whenever me and my fianc√© both use them and will continue for years to come."

"IF gets a lot of hate in the bodybuilding communities because lower meal frequency is going to mean fewer bouts of muscle protein synthesis, so speaking strictly physiologically it is a less efficient way of eating. 

Unless you are a competitor, and really do need to stress on optimizing every detail, it‚Äôs definitely an okay way to structure your diet if that‚Äôs what you prefer. I also don‚Äôt really get hungry until the afternoon and feel better on an empty stomach. Remember there are a lot of ways to do this and this is YOUR experience, so you can structure things according to your preference. 

Of course it‚Äôs going to vary from individual to individual, but unless you‚Äôre dieting for a show and already at a lower bodyfat percent, then you don‚Äôt have to be concerned with muscle loss, I use it for bulking as well as cutting. It‚Äôs just important to remember that it‚Äôs less optimal for that. This doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt make muscle gains or strength improvements, it just means that they happen slower."

"Making PED‚Äôs legal opens up a whole slew of issues in other sports tho. This isn‚Äôt just a bodybuilding thing. PED‚Äôs is a sport thing and if we legalize gear then it will be complicated for the Olympics and other world events. 

Steroids aren‚Äôt the inherent problem, it‚Äôs other shit like diuretics, fat burners, and to an extent insulin. Weight limits wouldn‚Äôt work if there‚Äôs a set weight cap. 250lbs is different on someone who‚Äôs 5‚Äô5 and 6‚Äô0. 

The biggest problem is that bodybuilders and gurus are big fucking idiots. Look at any S&amp;C coach for the Olympics and they have degrees, look at their ‚Äúsupplementation coaches‚Äù and they‚Äôll have degrees.

"Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôve learned that a narrow stance would increase the pressure on your ‚Äúouter‚Äù quads. At the very least the pressure moves over from the glutes to the quads. A wider stance hits heavier on teardrop/glutes. Was a while since I heard this and rarely care much about it myself, so don‚Äôt take my word for it. 

Edit: just a thought, but it seems logical (at least for me) that the angle of your foot has some in it as well. Try narrow legged squats, like pretty much knees and feet kept together. I go at it sometimes and it feels pretty neat."

"1) okay then fuck off back to wherever you came from

2) Ik you feel smart when you get all scientific, but dude people have been doing this for fucking years and it works. Bulk, cut, bulk, cut, etc. Show me someone who got good results without eating in a surplus ever, and I‚Äôll entertain your idea.

No one is telling this kid to get fat. We are telling him to eat in a surplus (I.e. a bulk). Eat 250-500 calories over maintenance a day for a .5-1lb gain a week. Of course it will not be all muscle, that‚Äôs what the cut is for.

If you want to spin your wheels eternally trying to eat exactly at maintenance (which hint: you fucking can‚Äôt) or in some tiny ass surplus, and net yourself 1 pound of gains in a year, be my guest. Even then it‚Äôs not like just because you went slower your body *has* to make all your gains lean. You can still put on fat no matter how slow you take it. Will a 500 surplus make you gain less fat than a 1000 calorie surplus? Sure. And no one here would advocate for that big of a surplus. However I promise you if you compare yourself to someone who spent 9 months in a 500 calorie surplus, and 3 months in a cut at the end of the year to you who wasnt eating in a surplus ever, the difference would be notable and not in your favor.

Do whatever you want but don‚Äôt go preaching it as the most efficient or even the most logical way to progress in bodybuilding. The pros are bulking cause it works. Go walk up to the biggest guy in your gym tomorrow and ask him if he‚Äôs ever eaten in a surplus lmao."

Being unemployed is starting to mess with my motivation.  I'm so much lazier than I was 3 months ago.  I've literally gone years without losing my motivation.  Hoping to find a job soon."
"As you said, the length seems like it's no issue, but how wide is it? If it's much wider than 7 feet then I'm sure you could bench in there. To me, it seems like deadlifts will be fairly simple in there, and so will OHP if you can get a rack that fits in there. 

My general advice would just be to look up online the barbell that you want to get, check its dimensions, and then measure the space in your patio to sort of plan out where it could go, and if it can realistically go up and down without hitting the wall when you lift.

Same thing goes for a bench, too. Most benches aren't that long so it's really just a matter of can your rack fit in there, and is the room long and wide enough for a barbell"
"It looks good imo, you could try different styles haha. But go for what you think looks the best on you"
"No coach yet but maybe in the future, I will be experimenting with myself through different methods like seeing what carb sources I respond well too, sodium amd carbloading to see how fast I fill up etc. I completely get you and I really appreciate the tips bro! I drop down in weight really quick so no crazy cardio in the beginning but will gradually increase it later in the cut! ‚úåüèæ"

"Okay, thank you for your input! I read that it wasn‚Äôt recommended to be in a deficit for more than 12 weeks so I had to confirm!"
"It's sarcasm. If you suspect a person you care about is unhappy, you should talk to him."
"Weak from the back, that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt place well at the O."

"Bruh, enjoy the DOMS! Ha! It's all worth it, though."
"Yep that‚Äôs exactly what it is. 

No idea how I‚Äôm going to adapt with the new job. Completely brand new role, still have my masters degree classes, it‚Äôs summer time, and I‚Äôm ready to step up my cutting. Trying to drop another 15 over summer. 

So like yeah, it‚Äôs a couple days, can‚Äôt stress about it. But like, I feel like I was owed these couple days of respite."
Maintenance phase will be beneficial but if you need a critique i would start adding in some oblique exercise to really make your midsection a strong point
"&gt; Will I risk muscle loss deloading on a cut? 

No more than you are already risking losing with the cut."
"You‚Äôre bulking, cheats only have a psychological benefit and yeah, eating a fuck tonne of shit will bloat you, either don‚Äôt be a prick on cheat meals or deal with it.

Nobody can say ‚Äúahh here‚Äôs your limit‚Äù, but there‚Äôs zero chance you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs reasonable and what‚Äôs excessive. Think it through.

If your only reason is to enjoy time and food with the family there‚Äôs also no reason to binge to the point of aesthetic disaster.

Want a simple solution? Stop eating when you feel guilty."
"Hey thank you so much for your msg. So informative!I agree that it's harder on a vegan diet as while I was focused on a few foods to gain muscle etc, I was still trying to make sure I get all the nutrients like b12 through food. So yes the education was key haha."
Just 2 scoops of creatine and of course broccoli

"Bought a hammer drill after struggling to drill one hole in garage floor for like 30 minutes and getting no where and it's a complete game changer. Sounds obvious, I know.

I'm building some overhead storage in the garage and have trusses, not joists, so everything's supported from the floor.

I should have bought one of these years ago.

Anyway, it's Monday the best day of the week: crush it."
I can relate. I play chess.
"Sorry, wasn't trying to mislead anyone. 

Around the time the news broke that he could put on 10 more pounds there were a lot of comments that lead me to believe some people thought that Bumstead was gonna show up 10 pounds heavier at the next Olympia. Title was simply meant to state that that doesn't seem to be the case. Obviously, packing that muscle over the next several years is another thing. 

&gt;He‚Äôs not going to try force pack 10lbs in a year

Correct. Perhaps I should have put ""for the next Olympia"" to be clearer."
I say this with love: I'd find a show further out. You're gonna want at least another month to diet. Why not be your best?
No
"Peacocking? lol no idea what that is. I just like the way it looks, have one for years."
He competed in the most recent Mr. Olympia lol
Yeah that‚Äôs a big issue rn. I‚Äôll keep looking! Thanks for ur encouragement bro

No one is going to check on you daily. Any good coach doesn‚Äôt chase their clients. If you have a question or concern it will be on you to reach out. That said I know several coaches that are in your budget and beginner friendly. LOUD Performance Training is one. I also work with non-professional men (I‚Äôm a woman though and you specifically mentioned wanting a man so...).
If I ever moved to TX then Austin is 100% the only place I would ever consider. The outlying suburbs are pretty nice too.
"I know it's been said that nobody fakes test, but let me elaborate a tiny bit more just so you (and any other new guys/gals reading this) can have peace of mind here.

Test is the flagship product of every UGL. If anything, your test might be slightly over-dosed to make it seem stronger or more effective. There are so many reputable UGLs and there are so many third-party boards that let users rate and interact with these UGLs. With even just 5 minutes of research there's no reason to get ripped off on your test.

Now, about the TRT clinic, they will most certainly prescribe you PCT/AI's/SERMs. BUT they may not do HCG if you're doing one of the big telemed clinics like Defy or Royal. New FDA regulations have stopped them from scripting HCG, but they'll still do other AI's and PCT. 

A ""real"" TRT clinic will likely get you whatever you're willing to pay for.. Test, HCG, AI's, SERMs, sometimes even Anavar."
"Good to hear! Did you finally take the shrooms?

"I disagree with the ‚Äúbad genetics‚Äù evaluation.

High protein (1.5g per lbs) make sure to train thinking that your gonna grow muscle as in dont just half ass and say ow im in a deficit like actively try to add weight or reps and at the very least dont let strength (the strength that you had in your own rep ranges prior to your cut) drop .

always leaves me with enough calories to have another lean meal totally free of guilt. I had a steak at dinner with friends tonight.

"Arnold was the most influential bodybuilder of all time and brought bodybuilding as close to the mainstream as it‚Äôs ever been. Ronnie was by far the greatest bodybuilder of all time though, which is what this poll is about. 8 Olympia titles against some of the toughest competition out there and a shape that‚Äôs never been close to being replicated since makes Ronnie by far the greatest bodybuilder to have ever stepped on stage. Meanwhile Arnold has 2 of the most controversial Olympia wins out there (1972 and 1980) and one of his wins had him as literally the only competitor on stage (1971). To put Arnold on the same level as Ronnie from a purely bodybuilding standpoint is ludicrous."

Definitely don‚Äôt lift while you are hungry. Eat a big breakfast every day thirty minutes before you lift. And don‚Äôt forget the protein supplements after. When I was trying to put on weight, all I did was eat. You get so sick of eating. 
Good luck."

"Good mate. Exercise and calorie deficits stripping muscle is over exaggerated.

Unless you're doing high frequency, long, intense cardio or eating in a severe calorie deficit (losing more than 1% bodyfat a week) - and this usually only counts if you're lean already - you'll be fine.

Like if you're above 12% - 15% bodyfat it really doesn't matter"
I‚Äôve been doing Insanity and absolutely love it!
lol at sarms
Cortisol control isn‚Äôt a joke
I think it‚Äôs a good question but in general I don‚Äôt think we should be counting movies as teaching. I don‚Äôt really know if I‚Äôve ever watched a Christmas movie in school tbh.
Well it seems like this was a folish post sorry guys ill take it down then
"40 days? Is this v your first show? Please put up a pic the day of your show, I'm curious how you'll come in the day if the show."
now im curious what they posted
that definitely sounds like him
Flexibility on the ground pose and triceps calves gluts lower back Christmas tree making it pop more!
"God, please no. Don‚Äôt make me overthink this again"
Nice obliques
Nice answer
"idk i keep the bench at the standard 45 degrees, i get a nasty chest pump from incline db so hopefully not too much"
to be fair his stage performance last O give him a little bit more credit than any average joe
"If you‚Äôd like to research this condition, causes and ways to regulate your cycle, it is called amenorrhea.

It typically happens to bodybuilding girls from being lean, hormone imbalance and/or gear."

"Amazing physique, as always from Ryan! As someone interested in the sport, I am curious how good he is as a paddleboarder."
"Looking good dude. Just curious, what amount are you away from your weight cap?"
"Free is the one being used for muscle and tissue growth. The  total means nothing to me since the free is what you feel when you use testosterone and getting the muscle build abilities from it. They didn‚Äôt use it because it wasn‚Äôt necessary just like huge physiological doses of tren wasn‚Äôt used back then either and they still look great and as mentioned test had more nasty side effects like bloating, hair loss, ect ect as with any testosterone based drug. They actually lifted and grew into their shows vs dropping 30 pounds to make weight. Testosterone has been around way longer then most androgens and wasn‚Äôt being really utilized until the 80s and so on and it wasn‚Äôt because they didn‚Äôt know about it. A good therapeutic dose of 200-300mg  isn‚Äôt bad but some of these guys jamming 1000+ a week makes me laugh because the guys 50 years ago looked awesome and didn‚Äôt have to use it. Seems more guys are dying off day by day and at a younger age and the guys using the gear i mentioned are still alive , but they didn‚Äôt know shit ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Ahhhhh the good ol ‚ÄúbUt GeNeTiCs‚Äù debate. Youre relying on this kid yo be a genetic hyper responder for him to be natty. No other reasons why he is?
Put this guy on DNP. Get his cut done in 48 hours!
"Myth quality meat/fatty fish and fresh or frozen greens and fruits, along with daily sunlight are a much better use of your money if your doctor isn‚Äôt worried about specific vitamins deficiencies."
Which ppl programs do you recommend? I have some lifting experience but I wouldn‚Äôt call myself an intermediate or advanced just yet
Looks more like chicken breast and broccoli to me.
"How many of you guys actually have good training partners? Used to train with a guy 4 years ago, really helped bring some intensity but we drifted in what we wanted to do in the gym. Haven‚Äôt had a good training partner since but I definitely miss it."

It looks a lot better in those pics
"Sergio is his own biggest fan. Real piece of shit to Fouad and Nick earlier this year too. Glad to see Nick say Sergio wasnt a tool to him at the Arnold, then again he seems to only want to talk shit on ig and not in person."
I‚Äôd argue his structure is what holds him back. Dude is a lean 200 off season but on stage will get outsized by dudes coming in lighter just cause his frame isn‚Äôt very large.
"They can say whatever, but it‚Äôs better to have people guess if your an idiot than remove all doubt. 

As for the constructive thing, how is telling someone lat symmetry is off 3 fucking weeks before the show constructive? Seriously?"
"He doesnt need a movie to help look bad, he's just a massive douchebag, thats his personality"
"Wow. Arnold, thank you. I really do appreciate that because I am trying my best. I'll be the first to admit I make a lot of mistakes, more than I wish, but I don't give up and I love helping everyone I can while I chase the goals in my life. I wish there were stronger words that existed in which I could express how deep my gratitude towards you is but all I can say is - thank you. And thank you for granting me one of those goals tonight. 

Also, my mom wanted me to tell you I'm half Austrian and that my 30th birthday is in two weeks :)"
Sounds like something a racist would say.
Take it however you want it. Sir. üò¥
"Sounds like good advice and kind of hits on why I'm thinking about switching. Not looking to compete and getting stronger is okay, but looking stronger is okay-er."
"Im doing reps to failure atm, itll be a while before i switch to anything"
"Yo anybody want to hit me with their hard rock/ metal workout playlists? Mines getting quite stale and I‚Äôm looking to add some new hitters to the rotation. 

Also wouldn‚Äôt mind if someone had some good EDM or trap rap playlists. Not as familiar with those but do enjoy them when I happen to catch the right one."
Will definitely give it a try.
"Yeah once you trade in your natty card, you'll always have an advantage over someone who never touched gear. Just the elevated number of myonuclei and satellite cells make it impossible for anyone who's used gear to ever return to a truly natural state."
"Honestly I don‚Äôt even use any apps to track, just plug shit on my calculator on my phone and it takes a few minutes out of my day if that. It‚Äôs easier than it sounds, calorie progression is pretty important for a deficit (especially if your deficit is relatively small like ~200 kcal)"
"You make a fairly convincing argument.  

This is definitely the highest bf% I've ever been at, which is kinda discouraging.  But I finally fill out shirts the way I like that that's not something I'd like to give up with a big cutting phase.  So right now I have my macros set for maintenance.

Maybe I just need to bite the bullet and do a proper cut.  Then again girls sometimes like the dad bod."
"Walking 10,000 plus steps a day on a cut is literally a bio hack."
Okay thanks I‚Äôll go for 500 surplus :) is it better?
"Yeah he has spent his time since winning his pro card putting on size. If you look at his photos from that show it is clear he had the frame to put the mass on. Matt Jansen knows how to get guys big, that is for sure. And that environment he trains in is perfect for him. His wife is a very high level competitor as well, she's a multi-time figure Olympian."
"Yeah, I‚Äôm not sure if the post is a joke or not?"

"Alright so python is super useful to know and it sounds like you‚Äôre on the right track.

A small piece of advice from someone who charges 4 figures a day as a contractor in the field, do not chase money. Money will come with time and experience.

Oh right we need one that tells the truth but also lies

"[Russian Fighter Pull Up Program] Started on 9,8,7,6,5. Currently on Day 7 at 10,9,8,7,7. Feel like im strugging at the 9-10 rep of my 1st set of 10 reps. Is this normal? I have read many good results of this programme such that people increase their pull up count from 9-14/15/16. Or is it just too early into the program to tell if im improving?

TLDR Quite worried as Day 7 into the program i seem to be not significantly stronger than Day 0. Advice?"
Thanks! About to hit them today üòä I plan on having a fro hawk or some natural style on show day!

"Just moved to a new city. After like two weeks, a gym bae adds me on ig. I followed her back, and what now? Do i dm her and ask her what's up or am i just overthinking this like a meathead that she's just following me to get the ""follow back""?"
Pppp-pulllll day. Gonna crush deadlifts tonight.
" is it fair to say everyone else feels the same way in the same situation? so any time I see someone playing games for hours I can be confident they feel the same as I would feel doing that? bc if you addressed someone about that sort of thing no doubt they wouldn't come out and say ""oh yeah man I feel like shit when I play games"", no they would say something like ""hey man it's just how I relax after work, mind your own Ps and Qs"". total bs? I think so but I always like hearing other people's thoughts"
As someone with a chronic illness (not crohns) I appreciate you and your efforts
"this is the advice I was looking for, thank you !"
I'm sure bud.
Just be sure you're losing around 1 lb a week. No more or less
"&gt;	why can‚Äôt you progress effectively by hitting each body part twice a week, with between 12 to 20 sets per week and progressively overloading your weight?

You can, that‚Äôs the point I‚Äôm making. You can even do it hitting the body part once a week if you prefer. It‚Äôs not that serious. Train hard, recover well."
"You have a low body fat percentage, which is why you‚Äôre able to distinguish between each muscle in your bicep. Good shit. Make sure you balance your arms by training your triceps on the backside of your arms. Plenty of workouts and information out there to put a good arm circuit in place."
Eh maybe the blood work was fake . But he had test levels of a 9year old girl and pre he was a-ok

Also, get your linked in game up to par. Then search every single day on linked in jobs, click ""easy apply"" and ""posted last 24 hours"", then apply to every job under the category you want. You should see a lot of calls for interviews by doing that!"
Okay Escanor...we see you

"Must be my lucky day,  opened a new can and the scoop was right on top.  Never happened before.  In fact, my last new can the scoop was all the way at the bottom and I didn't save the last previous scoop. (moved recently and cleaned out) Anyway,  better play the lottery."
"That‚Äôs the plan, gonna do it in a sec. thanks"
"Just do PPL 2x a week and don‚Äôt go lower than 6-8 reps. I too don‚Äôt care about strength training because it does zero for how you look. I care more about allowing the muscle I‚Äôm targeting to do the work. I still go heavy in a sense, but none of that 2-3 rep range garbage."
"Noob here. Is it bad to do 3 sets of dumbbell curls and then some more like 2 hours later? 

If so, why?"
"I've heard the same. Pretty much everyone I know has been on adhd meds at some point, most with a script. In college I made more money selling my monthly script to kids who claimed they needed it to function than I did at my off campus job"

Sorry brah
"On the left it looks like Dorian and Lou (mass monsters?)  Dude on tge right looks lije phil from the head but i really cant tell.  Conditioning for 90's guys and guys after is gonna always be a topic of discussion because the 90's was a transitional period.  Thanks to Dorian, ypu either said ""im gonna be bigger"" or ""im gonna double down on what I got"".  I think because of Dorian you had this and when Ronnie came it was like everybody agreed, Bigger is better.  Shawn Ray and Flex, perfect physiques but, standing next to a 300 lb Ronnie who is conditioned its like two 212 dudes decided the day of to do mens open bodybuilding.  Before the 90's even though im sure anabolics were around and stuff like but everyone did their best to emulate the winners meaning,  if he won looking like that i gotta try my best to look like that but better.  IMO, people didnt start speaking out for lack of conditioning until you had controversial olympia winners i.e. Injured Dorian and bubble guts in the past few years, plus i believe people are fascinated with mass monsters but at the end of the day its about the look, Shawn Rhoden imo proved that because like Psycho says ""You cant beat Phil trying to 'Be' Phil.  You gotta beat him with the best version of ""You"".  Its very subjective, im a fan of some mass monsters but i can tell some of them wont ever smell a top 2 or 3 placing at the Olympia because they just dont look as relatable or just aestheticly pleaseing compared to others.  Ramy, was sooo much better than EVERYBODY else it wasnt close.  The side chest shot is iconic but the difference now is that Ramy understood he was already bigger than everybody else so now the question is what will make me ""Look Better"" than everybody else.  Like, getting bigger is not impossible for people, making that shit look good is another AND THEN, being compared in a line up is even harder.  Just what i think.  Agree to Disagree."
Lol ok whatever you say sweet heart
"No, I mean more in the sense that all of the current stress and mental health issues that come with the situation, some people being full WFH, plus well, that in a lot of places they don't have gyms available, could justify a little weight gain, the situation is complex af. But as I say, a little, not getting overweight/obese haha."
"I like to do standing or bent over with cables, one arm at a time. Mind-muscle connection is really important IME. Also try to get several sets, not just a few."
He‚Äôs definitely not 5‚Äô10‚Äù
"Wow, incredible. Were you using before? Solid work!"
"Well for starters there is no perfect diet so straying from your plan is only a bad thing if you make it so. No one is perfect, life gets in the way(and it should, there's more to life than bodybuilding) and everyone has to adapt and compensate once in a while. Allowing yourself diet freedom is a good thing and will make it much easier to stick to this lifestyle in the long term. Theres a time and a place to be on point and that time doesn't exist for most of us. Let the professionals beat themselves up over extra calories/missed meals"
Ok
"If you want a preworkout that will make you laser focused, get dmaa irate. Mindblowing good and not overstimmed like dark energy"
"Very true, the program seemed amazing! Plus I really vibed well with the coach! They just bought a new weightroom which is their 3rd now but it‚Äôs gotta be worth close to a million dollars or more lmao


I‚Äôm pretty certain since it‚Äôs through the NCAA that every team member would be drug tested atleast 2-3 times a year minimum but obviously if someone had inside information they could work around that with no issues. Personally I don‚Äôt think the shot put guy was on gear because yes he had big muscles but he didn‚Äôt have any definition or vascularity at all. I know that‚Äôs not a great indicator but at the same time the coach could pretty easily have said he was heavier than he actually is"

Just do 531 BBB if you want more volume. I always fall back on some variation of 531 when I need something simple that I can get done in an hour or less when work / life gets busy. I made the most progress in terms of putting on overall size by running 531 variations for about 18 months.

"I like prep vlogs as long as they aren‚Äôt too long or too often. Prep is about consistent progress day to day, which can be pretty hard to see on a daily basis. So as long as it‚Äôs put out there no more often than weekly, maybe a bit more often the last 2-3 weeks, it‚Äôs pretty interesting. I also appreciate it when they are more matter of fact about what‚Äôs going well or poorly instead of rah-rah motivational bullshit."

"Yeah man I got lucky, my mom's sister married a doctor who became the ""rich uncle""

So my mom and aunt went out shopping, stopped by Electronics Boutique so my aunt could get one for my cousins. The cashier jokingly said ""We've got 2 left, why not take both of them!?""  so she did lol 

Had to get my SNES used back in the day, and our NES was won at a raffle even further back. We always had shit, it just took some finagling to get it."
Wow!!! Those are some thighs girl!!! Yeehaw! She really put in the work for her physic I respect that.

"For me, it's like I'll never be able to see how much fitter/slimmer/prettier/stronger/whatever I am than I was before, or how much fitter I am than the average person. I can ONLY see how far I am from my ideal or goal, and the goal is always moving."

Does anyone have suggestions to prevent elbow soreness? Having some mild discomfort and plan on not locking anything out the next few weeks to alleviate that but not sure if I should be doing any prehab type stuff as well.
"Fair point but if we‚Äôre being objective, both Ronnie and Jay had already proven themselves on the Olympia stage prior to their guts getting out of control. For example Ronnie was a multi crowned Olympian prior to his midsection issues. In his later years I do feel the judges forgave his gut problems a bit because of his earned status. Now with Nick he had midsection distension even before he became a pro, although it does look like he‚Äôs worked a lot to remedy the situation though, so big respect in that regard."
"Sometimes I get sad that I can‚Äôt see my tricep all the time but then I realize at least other people can and that makes me feel better.

Thanks so much for your reply! I‚Äôll definitely look into this and try some. I appreciate it
Favorite workout routine?
"Honestly not a ton without having seen you the duration of a prep, knowing your diet, if you‚Äôve manipulated sodium, etc. The most ideal situation is to not have to manipulate water at all toward the end of a prep and into a peak. It‚Äôs starting to become an outdated method. This is also dependent on how many carbs you‚Äôre loading, if you‚Äôre taking diuretics, etc. There‚Äôs just a lot that goes into it that I‚Äôm not confident in any answer I can give without weeks and weeks of info."
"fucking teach me if i'm wrong asshole, i am open to forming new opinions. you cant just disagree with me and provide literally ZERO reason for me to believe you. why would I change my mind if you're not gonna show me how im wrong and instead just be a dick?"
"I was super setting incline DB bench and bent DB rows for the second day in a row. I didn‚Äôt feel an acute pain, but felt really weak and a dull pain slowly crept on. That injury kept me out of the gym for several months. I couldn‚Äôt open a door or even hold a laptop in my right arm. My shoulders sat noticeably uneven. I eventually saw an MAT therapist and I started doing rehab and getting tissue work done under my armpit. Eventually, while working on my pec minor, I heard a loud pop, and my arm fell back into place. I can still feel the scar tissue in my rhomboid, and it hurts if I do upper body without warming up my upper back. This was like 7 years ago. 

So my advice is don‚Äôt fuck around with your upper back and rotator cuffs. And when you do hit them, slowly crank up the volume. Don‚Äôt go straight to 20 sets a week."
Your thighs are insane bro
"I do like 2 and a half to 3 hours of cardio a week, average 10-15k steps a day and lift for 1.5 hours 3 days on one off. 

I was at 3200 calories and stopped gaining so I've just increased the cals every two weeks of no progress and I haven't made any progress in like a month. Went from 3300, to 3500, and now 3500 to 3650. 

I guess my body just doesn't want to change all that much. I don't even have scale fluctuations over one pound even when I've increased carbs by almost 100g a day."
"Thanks! Man idk, adjustable dumbbells do not get me excited to workout. 

I do a Meadows variant for lateral raises sometimes.

Half ROM heavy as I can, lift the lats as high as they can (so 40‚Äôs) for 12 reps then do 12 reps with 12 lb weights.

I bet doing the floor flies with 40‚Äôs for 12 reps then doing the Arnold flies for 12 with lower weight would be a killer superset"

"Looking thick, solid, and tight.  

But seriously focus on your facial expression and smile. Nobody wants a competitor on stage looking like they‚Äôre trying to force out a world record dump."
Just Not straining it and massage will help it. Use a lacrosse ball and yoga block. You need to just take a break. Don‚Äôt make the injury worst
"Dude your legit motivating me because i started just as fat as you were. I always see progress pics of people starting out skinny then getting buff, rarely fat people getting buff. If a previously fat person can get stage lean, then for sure i can get lean enough to get a 6 pack."

"Nah man I feel ya I've been at maintenance (2.5k cals) for 2 weeks. Starting my bulk tomorrow.

Whats helped me feel a little less hungry is intermittent fasting and only eating between 12 - 8 pm. Something about eating breakfast just makes me an absolute slut for food for the rest of the day."
So you think it will look exactly like it did before the tear? Assuming he rebuilds the mass.
"Minor injury, non-COVID illness, waiting for the vaccine, car problems, a family thing, or the tried and true ignoring his calls/messages. You gotta be able to come up with *something.* Or just tell him to fuck off."

"Great progress on the fat loss, however, Bikini requires a lot more muscle than what you can gain in 7 weeks. You need a good year or two of weightlifting and lean gains before you'll have a Bikini physique."
"Yeah, Chris definitely has much better flow to his physique. As do Terrence and Breon. Steve looks incredible, but his physique just doesn't flow to me. Just looks like a bunch of amazing individual body parts. Not sure man. This is why bodybuilding is so weird for a lot of people. Its so subjective that even when someone wins, its rarely if ever clear."
Cool üëåüèª
"Steroids.  

It's an unfortunate thing that's going on among fitness influencers where people adamantly deny doing performance enhancing drugs yet try to sell their audience results that are impossible to achieve without doing so.  

Reasons for this are mainly the fact that steroids are illegal in most western countries including the US and the fact that supplement companies are very hesitant if not outright denying to give sponsorship deals to influencers that do not claim they are natural."

Fair enough. Might go for a vanilla or even cookies and cream since ive never had it
Lol imagine trying to argue that Ronnie is the GOAT when [this man](https://imgur.com/a/NhY5n7H) exists. It‚Äôs like comparing one of those nasty massive HGH filled cheapo chicken breasts at Walmart to a beautiful natural slim but perfect amount of meat free range local farmers market chicken breast. Do you even care about aesthetics? My wife tells me all the time that bigger isn‚Äôt always better and I think that‚Äôs very applicable in this situation.

"I definitely agree when it comes to the alcoholism. Especially as a guy, you‚Äôre expected to drink like 3 beers every time you go out to socialize. I just do what Arnold used to do and just dump it out and fill it with water to make people think you‚Äôre drinking or I‚Äôll just take one beer and sip it once and then carry it around with me to seem like I already have a drink."

My own Mom said I had chicken legs. Pretty sure I was sub-100 lbs at the time.
"Take it easy and look at it as a long term process. Monitor your bf% with as many tools as possible, pics, measurements and bf calipers are a good combination. 0.6 lbs per week sounds quite reasonable if you're doing that cycle IMO, could even aim for a little more if you don't see bf% go up.

If you're starving with that many calories (unless you're a really big guy, could make sense there) I'd look at food selection and distribution throughout the different meals, you may be hungry at some points in the day but starving is too much. Could also be something more mental due to all the restrictions during the cut."

"You'd be surprised to learn how many guys around here build massive legs by only working them once every 4-7 days. Some guys may do about 1 and 1/2 leg days during a week, and now that's to *grow* them.

The part of the program you're on is all about maintaining what you've got while you focus on other parts of your body. You can 10000% maintain leg muscle mass just one day a week.

"I definitely wouldn't say they ""don't build anything"". They're good for glutes, erectors and hamstrings, as well as the upper back to a lesser extent.

They're probably not *the* best exercise for any of those muscles, but they cover a lot of bases for one movement. In fact if I could only do one exercise for hypertrophy it would probably be a variation on the deadlift."

"So let me get this straight- you think the media keeps mentioning that it's deadly because it's *not* deadly? That they would only repeat it frequently if it was all a big lie? Have you considered that maybe the media just tends to mention the basic facts of big things that are going on?

About competing just foken do it gain some experience ü§ù and try again and again and again soon or later you'll  succeed
Starting at 12?! Boy you better keep going and do not stop at all. Don't let anyone get in your way or put you down. Keep going to the gym.
He isnt even going to the Olympia this year lol
I‚Äôm guilty of 1
thank you! i was googling and noticed this too! i appreciate your tip!
"I'm sure your assumption is right, looks like prep and I'm sure it doesn't help at all, just adding to the list. Me personally, nothing fucks with my skin. Tren, nandrolone, orals, none of it even at higher doses. The only thing that touches it and my hair are e2 issues."
"Feel free to post your videos doing less than half reps for everyone else to see then.

Let's see those leg presses or the OHP you regularly come here to brag about. I've already seen it, I know how hilarious it is. 

You're probably the worst ego lifter here."
"&gt; I don't feel adequate academically

I think literally everybody deals with this at some point in acedemia my dude. You are in the right place. You wouldnt have made it this far if you werent."
Looks like we got to see the black cloud in action bro
"Look amazing for 6'3"" my guy"
Your husband looks hella good but you‚Äôre mogging the everloving shit out of him when he has a shirt on üòÇ
"They don‚Äôt like to feed the trolls around here. This a pretty serious forum all in all. I mean, I‚Äôve scrolled this far and only seen one guy make a leg joke. 

Also, I got troll-ish vibes but wasn‚Äôt sure‚Ä¶. Until I saw pointy elbows. Lol. Great addition."
"When you look up douche in the dictionary it redirects you to Mike O'Hearn

Dude is such a loser"
Got 1700 buckaroos from my graduation party. Is it bad that the first thing I wanted to buy that came to my mind was creatine since I ran out?
Dude in the back lookin at you guys like ‚Äúok great you got your pics can I take a shit now?‚Äù
"Older, out of shape people love to say ‚Äúoh this‚Äôll be you someday‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I sure hope not"
Lol no it's not.
Thank you man
"It‚Äôs hepatotoxic, you dumbass. Try‚Äôs to act smart and doesn‚Äôt know actual word.
Takes steroids to look aesthetically appealing, looks like he has fucking chickenpox üòÇüòÇ"
You want to build 50lbs of muscle in 2yrs?
"Heard it‚Äôs too sweet but I love sweet ones, may give it a go"
"No way, with the amount of juice this guy takes, 6?!?! I am guessing 4 inches at most!"
"I was sick for a bit and it screwed my gym schedule up, I was at 4-5 times a week and now I'm back to 2-3 a week. I really don't like how easily it is to slip up and get out of the groove for me. How do you guys get back into the swing of things?"
You would do well in men's physique. You have a very good developed upper body but maybe better hiding those quads under some board shorts until they grow.
Congratz my man! Looking like a greek sculpture come to life!
I found some at my local 99 cent store lmao
"Damn man, been almost 2 years for me but i remember that pain early on. That deep horrible feeling. It gets better though, find distractions, reconnect with friends, and get those sweet sweet breakup gains!"
Honest question for you: why SARMs and not just actual gear? Like if you want to go the enhanced route why not just do the stuff that everyone agrees works?
"Gunna have to hard disagree. I get they aren‚Äôt necessary but nothing replaces a good deadlift for results, and when done carefully I see minimal downsides tbh.

It‚Äôs real individual though and of course they just don‚Äôt agree with some."
"Ok I‚Äôll check it out thanks, also lmk if you want to e date bud"
"I hate how people justify having outside dogs. Like maybe unless you live on a farm and have multiple dogs, but otherwise don‚Äôt get the animal if you won‚Äôt give it affection and attention inside"
Thanks man I am taking training very serious I go to beyond the failure every set I do I can tell u that I believe that I work hard than anyone that training at my gym add to that I gain muscle very quickly maybe the hard work may be genetics may be both
Does he still have chance to qualify?
Can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre joking or not but I actually did poop a little bit
"No, this is the buy&amp;hold GME thread."
"No, you should definitely still be popping every day."
"Thanks man, will do"
"Important supplements would be a multivitamin, fish oil tablets and you could also get some creatine. MyProtein has the best (read: highest doses of stuff) multivitamins that I've found (they're called alpha man tablets on their website). Take 5g of creatine per day in your morning orange juice or shake, whatever. Ignore anyone that tells you to stack doses or any other weird tip involving creatine. There's a lot of fake bro science involving this supplement.

In terms of protein, just get basic whey. MyProtein also has the cheapest you can find, most folks just use that. The flavours can get tiring so I'd recommend getting a couple different flavours to swap between. If you're struggling to get in calories, you could try a weight gainer but check the ingredients so that it's not just packed with sugar, as many are. You want one where the carbs are from ground oats. You could also just buy a bag of oats and blend those into the protein powder. Remember real food is better, and I generally try not to exceed more than 3 scoops per day.

Preworkout is also nice to have for when you really need an extra boost for a workout. But, importantly, I don't use it before every workout. Probably twice a week. It can be fairly expensive and you don't want to find that you depend on it to get through a workout every day. Most are fine, I personally prefer ones with more than one stimulant, ie caffeine + beta alanine rather than just one stim source."
Size matters bro
Some good stuff man
Finally getting out of my horrible job. Taking a bit of a pay cut but I‚Äôm moving to a lot better company with huge growth potential. Turning in my resignation today and I can‚Äôt wait
More definition in lower back and forearm work.
"I get it and I agree, cant help seeing ""r/fitness mentality"" as a little pretentious/gatekeep still"
How many here identify as super straight?
"Its true, dont dreamerbulk"
No I have male pattern baldness
"Great shape,looking very impressive man!
Back is behind size wise tho,you gotta hit it HARD in the next offseason.
Good luck at your show"
looks to have something wrong w/ his shoulder. maybe a rotator injury. i have the same issue and it looks very similar to this.
Been waiting for that Titan Safety Squat Bar on their Scratch and Dent for a while now. Only a matter of time.
"no i dont eat before only after, and this feeling of vomiting only happens when im over head pressing and not on any other exercise"
"&gt;most people giving advice here shouldn't

Absolutely agreed. Way too many random people with zero source or credentials give advice they're just regurgitating."
"Gamma Bomb Week 2 is getting fun. 

The 60 seconds hanging from the pull up bar at the tail end is surprisingly brutal."
"Great physique, üëç"
thx killme
Seems like you started with posing training and couple years later you added bodybuiling for perfection
"Birdbox, not knowing what they saw freaks me out"
"Funny part of that video is when Guy tells the kid to meet him outside. Like brotha, you‚Äôre a bodybuilder who would get slept with one overhand."
Thanks man!
I think he's really good at burning every bridge possible
Is It a good choice going from.P.H.A.T during a Blast to P.H.U.L during PCT?
Are the Suns winning a chip?
Pretty much how it went down
Or maybe I‚Äôm secretly cruising and playing the long con.
Zero calorie monsters are absolutely delicious
"Either or. I like HCL better because I don‚Äôt seem to have any extra bloat whatsoever but the effects are the same for my strength. I also like the fact you can take less for the same effect. That‚Äôs because I only buy pure unflavored powders and mix together my own preworkout. Soooo much better *and* cheaper. I also recommend for anyone doing this to buy some [Blate Papes](https://www.amazon.com/Blate-Papes-Squares-Tasteless-Consumption/dp/B08H6V7BQC/) squares or pouches to swallow the powder. I used to make my own caps for a while, which sucked, then I tried holding my nose which sucked even more. This is the best way to take unflavored powders imo"
lmao can i get the link to this sounds funny
I don't max squat anymore because of a dodgy knee but I can do a 180 for a comfortable 2. Congrats on your PR!
jealous
Definitely don't go to  goatse dot cx
idk how reliable it would be since a lot of athletes will just blame their coach when something isn't working when in reality they were being bad soldiers or just don't work well with that coaching style. also don't know how much info people would be able to give out without exposing protocols which breaches most coach-client agreements. your best bet will always be to ask athletes you personally trust about their experiences
"The market as whole

  And yeah, they didn't seem to have much in stock either?



  Many places have them for similar or cheaper even considering shipping.  Not saying they are bad, just they seemed very in line with all other retailers for similar products. /shrug"
Literally no way for us to know this but probably not. Leave it alone and go to the doctor if it doesn‚Äôt stop hurting.
"Well, gyms in my country are being shut down for 3 weeks. Until then I have to resort to calisthenics. Will I lose progress on my main lifts?"
"It's a no brainer really. Bodybuilding is 100% about showing of your muscles as well as possible.  That's why guys get such ridiculous tans.

Tattoos are extremely counterproductive and when it's close the judge need to look for every flaw.

Also, if you can't keep your body clean for the sake of the sport you probably don't deserve it as much as the clean guy."
You look good dude. Just keep improving. 5 weeks to get better. Every 3 days you should see a slight difference.
Hell yeah!
"Yeah, sadly a lot of people that are into gym culture are also far right or into rugged individualism."
