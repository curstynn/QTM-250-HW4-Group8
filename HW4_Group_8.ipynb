        "\n",
        "The Natural Language API provided by Google Cloud contains powerful and well-trained models to apply natural language understanding (NLU) to text in a varity of languages. Available applications include sentiment analysis, entity analysis, content classification, syntax analysis, and so on. It can process different types of text, and is used widely by developers around the world. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "[Introduction of Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language)\n",
        "\n",
        "Two of the qualities of sentiment measure by the Natural Language API are polarity and magnitude. Polarity is the distinction between positive and negative attitudes in the text, while magnitude is the amount of emotional contect present in the text. In this study, we are only interested in the polarity output, because it has direct association with whether the comment is positive or negative, and we have less focus on the magnitude of such emotions. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Testing the API's Performance**\n",
        "\n",
        "But how well does the API determine emotional valence within a text? Presumably, a sophisticated text analysis tool within the Google suite of applications would be able to assess emotional context with pinpoint accuracy. But what if the API was tasked with analyzing the vernacular of a group of individuals so far gone that their main mode of communication is essentially screaming and beating rocks with sticks? That's right! We're talking about bodybuilders. \n",
        "\n",
        "Naturally, when these meatheads take to the Internet to let out their testosterone-induced gripes with their world (aka. the local LA Fitness), they aren't speaking with the same sophistication expected of an Emory student diligently studying QTM 250. In fact, just like you don't expect one of these neanderthals to bushwhack at you at Chipotle and start talking to you about the various benefits of consuming BCAA proteins, you don't expect them to talk within the same parameters an ordinary person would. For example, when you hop on Reddit's r/bodybuilding thread or the forums on bodybuilding.com, you can see posts ranging from a simple \"lol brah blast tren\" (translation = Good day, sir; consider taking steroids.) to a 5 paragraph war-torn battle story about how _barbelldaddy441 struggled his whole life being skinny before turning his life around with hard work in at his highschool gym. Furthermore, a community like this has endless jargon. Aside from being frequent users of standard US slang like \"bruh,\" \"ya,\" and \"sorta,\" bodybuilders also use a lot of terms of their own. For example, \"juice\" or \"sauce\" means steroids, while \"yoked\" or \"jacked\" means muscular in an aesthetic way. \n",
        "\n",
        "Clearly, there is a vast range of outcomes possible when someone like a bodybuilder sits down to type at their laptop, perhaps too many for even machine learning to keep up with. To test this, we present Google's Natural Language API with a dataset of posts taken from Reddit's r/bodybuilding- some short, some long, some with slang, some without- and task it with determining the sentiment of each. Then we, the researchers, assess the same posts ourselves to benchmark how well the API performed with the different types of posts. Regarding two variables of the length and the existence of slang, we hypothesize that the API will better predict the sentiments of the posts with less text and slang than posts that are longer (as more complicated emotions are often associated with longer text) and riddled with words that nobody, especially not a machine, has ever heard before. \n",
